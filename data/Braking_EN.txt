Scope


1.1.

This Regulation applies to the braking of vehicles of categories M1 and N1.1

1.2.

This Regulation does not cover:

1.2.1.

Vehicles with a design speed not exceeding 25 km/h;

1.2.2.

Vehicles fitted for invalid drivers;

1.2.3.

The approval of the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Brake Assist System(s) (BAS) of the vehicle.





2.





Definitions


For the purposes of this Regulation,

2.1.

" Approval of a vehicle" means the approval of a vehicle type with regard to braking.

2.2.

" Vehicle type" means a category of vehicles which do not differ in such essential respects as:

2.2.1.

The maximum mass, as defined in paragraph 2.11. below;

2.2.2.

The distribution of mass among the axles;

2.2.3.

The maximum design speed;

2.2.4.

A different type of braking equipment, with more particular reference to the presence or otherwise of equipment for braking a trailer or any presence of electric braking system;

2.2.5.

The engine type;

2.2.6.

The number and ratios of gears;

2.2.7.

The final drive ratios;

2.2.8.

The tyre dimensions.

2.3.

" Braking equipment" means the combination of parts whose function is progressively to reduce the speed of a moving vehicle or bring it to a halt, or to keep it stationary if it is already halted; these functions are specified in paragraph 5.1.2. below. The equipment consists of the control, the transmission, and the brake proper.

2.4.

" Control" means the part actuated directly by the driver to furnish to the transmission the energy required for braking or controlling it. This energy may be the muscular energy of the driver, or energy from another source controlled by the driver, or a combination of these various kinds of energy.





1 This Regulation offers an alternative set of requirements for category N1 vehicles to those contained in UN Regulation No. 13. Contracting Parties that apply both UN Regulation No. 13 and this Regulation recognize approvals to either Regulation as equally valid. M1 and N1 categories of vehicles are defined in the Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3), document ECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.6, para. 2 -

2.5.

" Transmission" means the combination of components comprised between the control and the brake and linking them functionally. The transmission may be mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electric or mixed. Where the braking power is derived from or assisted by a source of energy independent of the driver, the reserve of energy in the system is likewise part of the transmission.



The transmission is divided into two independent functions: the control transmission and the energy transmission. Whenever the term "transmission"

is used alone in this Regulation, it means both the "control transmission" and the "energy transmission":

2.5.1.

" Control transmission" means the combination of the components of the transmission which control the operation of the brakes, including the control function and the necessary reserve(s) of energy;

2.5.2.

" Energy transmission" means the combination of the components which supply to the brakes the necessary energy for their function, including the reserve(s) of energy necessary for the operation of the brakes.

2.6.

" Brake" means the part in which the forces opposing the movement of the vehicle develop. It may be a friction brake (when the forces are generated by friction between two parts of the vehicle moving relatively to one another); an electrical brake (when the forces are generated by electro-magnetic action between two parts of the vehicle moving relatively to but not in contact with one another); a fluid brake (when the forces are generated by the action of a fluid situated between two parts of the vehicle moving relatively to one another); or an engine brake (when the forces are derived from an artificial increase in the braking action, transmitted to the wheels, of the engine).

2.7.

" Different types of braking equipment" means equipment which differ in such essential respects as:

2.7.1.

Components having different characteristics;

2.7.2.

A component made of materials having different characteristics, or a component differing in shape or size;

2.7.3.

A different assembly of the components.

2.8.

" Component of the braking equipment" means one of the individual parts which, when assembled, constitutes the braking equipment.

2.9.

" Progressive and graduated braking" means braking during which, within the normal operating range of the device, and during actuation of the brakes (see paragraph 2.16. below):

2.9.1.

The driver can at any moment increase or decrease the braking force by acting on the control;

2.9.2.

The braking force varies proportionally as the action on the control (monotonic function);

2.9.3.

The braking force can be easily regulated with sufficient precision.

2.10.

" Laden vehicle" means, except where otherwise stated, a vehicle so laden as to attain its "maximum mass".

2.11.

" Maximum mass" means the maximum mass stated by the vehicle manufacturer to be technically permissible (this mass may be higher than the

"permissible maximum mass" laid down by the national administration).

2.12.

" The distribution of mass among the axles" means the distribution of the effect of the gravity on the mass of the vehicle and/or its contents among the axles.

2.13.

" Wheel/axle load" means the vertical static reaction (force) of the road surface in the contact area on the wheel/wheels of the axle.

2.14.

" Maximum stationary wheel/axle load" means the stationary wheel/axle load achieved under the condition of the laden vehicle.

2.15.

" Hydraulic braking equipment with stored energy" means a braking equipment where energy is supplied by a hydraulic fluid under pressure, stored in one or more accumulator(s) fed from one or more pressure pump(s), each fitted with a means of limiting the pressure to a maximum value. This value shall be specified by the manufacturer.

2.16.

" Actuation" means both application and release of the control.

2.17.

" Electric regenerative braking" means a braking system which, during deceleration, provides for the conversion of vehicle kinetic energy into electrical energy.

2.17.1.

" Electric regenerative braking control" means a device which modulates the action of the electric regenerative braking system;

2.17.2.

" Electric regenerative braking system of category A" means an electric regenerative braking system which is not part of the service braking system; 2.17.3.

" Electric regenerative braking system of category B" means an electric regenerative braking system which is part of the service braking system; 2.17.4.

" Electric state of charge" means the instantaneous ratio of electric quantity of energy stored in the traction battery relative to the maximum quantity of electric energy which could be stored in this battery;

2.17.5.

" Traction battery" means an assembly of accumulators constituting the storage of energy used for powering the traction motor(s) of the vehicle.

2.18.

" Phased braking" is a means which may be used where two or more sources of braking are operated from a common control, whereby one source may be given priority by phasing back the other source(s) so as to make increased control movement necessary before they begin to be brought into operation.

2.19.

" Nominal value" definitions for braking reference performance are required to put a value on the transfer function of the braking system, relating output to input for vehicles individually.

2.19.1.

" Nominal value" is defined as the characteristic which can be demonstrated at type approval and which relates the braking rate of the vehicle on its own to the level of the braking input variable.

2.20.

" Automatically commanded braking" means a function within a complex electronic control system where actuation of the braking system(s) or brakes of certain axles is made for the purpose of generating vehicle retardation with or without a direct action of the driver, resulting from the automatic evaluation of on-board initiated information.

2.21.

" Selective braking" means a function within a complex electronic control system where actuation of individual brakes is made by automatic means in which vehicle retardation is secondary to vehicle behaviour modification.

(b)

The 04 series of amendments for vehicles with a coupling system for charging the Rechargeable Electric Energy Storage System (traction batteries).

5.1.1.5.

A failure detection signal may interrupt momentarily (< 10 ms) the demand signal in the control transmission, provided that the braking performance is thereby not reduced.

5.1.2.

Functions of the braking equipment



The braking equipment defined in paragraph 2.3. of this Regulation shall fulfil the following functions:

5.1.2.1.

Service braking system



The service braking system shall make it possible to control the movement of the vehicle and to halt it safely, speedily and effectively, whatever its speed and load, on any up or down gradient. It shall be possible to graduate this braking action. The driver shall be able to achieve this braking action from his driving seat without removing his hands from the steering control.

5.1.2.2.

Secondary braking system



The secondary braking system shall make it possible by application of the service brake control to halt the vehicle within a reasonable distance in the event of failure of the service braking system. It shall be possible to graduate this braking action. The driver shall be able to obtain this braking action from his driving seat without removing his hands from the steering control. For the purposes of these provisions it is assumed that not more than one failure of the service braking system can occur at one time.

5.1.2.3.

Parking braking system



The parking braking system shall make it possible to hold the vehicle stationary on an up or down gradient even in the absence of the driver, the working parts being then held in the locked position by a purely mechanical device. The driver shall be able to achieve this braking action from his driving seat.

5.1.3.

The requirements of Annex 8 shall be applied to the safety aspects of all complex electronic vehicle control systems, including those defined in an independent regulation, which provide or form part of the control transmission of the braking function, included those which utilize the braking system(s) for automatically commanded braking or selective braking.



However, vehicles equipped with systems or functions, including those defined in an independent regulation, which use the braking system as the means of achieving a higher level objective, are subject to Annex 8 only insofar as they have a direct effect on the braking system. If such systems are provided, they shall not be deactivated during type approval testing of the braking system.

5.1.4.

Provisions for the periodic technical inspection of braking systems 5.1.4.1.

It shall be possible to assess the wear condition of the components of the service brake that are subject to wear e.g. friction linings and drums/discs (in the case of drums or discs, wear assessment may not necessarily be carried out at the time of periodic technical inspection). The method by which this may be realized is defined in paragraphs 5.2.11.2. of this Regulation.

UNECE R 13-H-01



5.1.4.2.

It shall be possible to verify, in a frequent and simple way, the correct operational status of those complex electronic systems which have control over braking. If special information is needed, this shall be made freely available.

5.1.4.2.1.

Where the operational status is indicated to the driver by warning signals, as specified in this Regulation, it shall be possible at a periodic technical inspection to confirm the correct operational status by visual observation of the warning signals following a power-on.

5.1.4.2.2.

At the time of type approval, the means implemented to protect against simple unauthorized modification of the operation to the verification means chosen by the manufacturer (e.g. warning signal) shall be confidentially outlined.

Alternatively, this protection requirement is fulfilled when a secondary means of checking the correct operational status is available.

5.1.4.3.

It shall be possible to generate maximum braking forces under static conditions on a rolling road or roller brake tester.

5.2.

Characteristics of braking systems

5.2.1.

The set of braking systems with which a vehicle is equipped shall satisfy the requirements laid down for service, secondary and parking braking systems.

5.2.2.

The systems providing service, secondary and parking braking may have common components so long as they fulfil the following conditions: 5.2.2.1.

There shall be at least two controls, independent of each other and readily accessible to the driver from his normal driving position. Every brake control shall be designed such that it returns to the fully off position when released.

This requirement shall not apply to a parking brake control when it is mechanically locked in an applied position;

5.2.2.2.

The control of the service braking system shall be independent of the control of the parking braking system;

5.2.2.3.

The effectiveness of the linkage between the control of the service braking system and the different components of the transmission systems shall not be liable to diminish after a certain period of use;

5.2.2.4.

The parking braking system shall be so designed that it can be actuated when the vehicle is in motion. This requirement may be met by the actuation of the vehicle's service braking system, even partially, by means of an auxiliary control;

5.2.2.5.

Without prejudice to the requirements of paragraph 5.1.2.3. of this Regulation, the service braking system and the parking braking system may use common components in their transmission(s), provided that in the event of a failure in any part of the transmission(s) the requirements for secondary braking are still ensured;

5.2.2.6.

In the event of breakage of any component other than the brakes (as defined in paragraph 2.6. above) and the components referred to in paragraph 5.2.2.10.

below, or of any other failure of the service braking system (malfunction, partial or total exhaustion of an energy reserve), that part of the service braking system which is not affected by the failure, shall be able to bring the vehicle to a halt in the conditions prescribed for secondary braking;

5.2.2.7.

If service braking is ensured by the action of the driver's muscular energy assisted by one or more energy reserves, secondary braking shall, in the event 10

Internal Use Only. Prepared on 09.02.2023.

UNECE R 13-H-01



of failure of that assistance, be capable of being ensured by the driver's muscular energy assisted by the energy reserves, if any, which are unaffected by the failure, the force applied to the service brake control not exceeding the prescribed maximum;

5.2.2.8.

If the service braking force and transmission depend exclusively on the use, controlled by the driver, of an energy reserve, there shall be at least two completely independent energy reserves, each provided with its own transmission, likewise independent; each of them may act on the brakes of only two or more wheels so selected as to be capable of ensuring by themselves the prescribed degree of secondary braking without endangering the stability of the vehicle during braking; in addition, each of the aforesaid energy reserves shall be equipped with a warning device as defined in paragraph 5.2.14. below; 5.2.2.9.

If the service braking force and transmission depend exclusively on the use of an energy reserve, one energy reserve for the transmission is deemed to be sufficient, provided that the prescribed secondary braking is ensured by the action of the driver's muscular energy acting on the service brake control and the requirements of paragraph 5.2.5. below are met;

5.2.2.10.

Certain parts, such as the pedal and its bearing, the master cylinder and its piston or pistons, the control valve, the linkage between the pedal and the master cylinder or the control valve, the brake cylinders and their pistons, and the lever-and-cam assemblies of brakes, shall not be regarded as liable to breakage if they are amply dimensioned, are readily accessible for maintenance, and exhibit safety features at least equal to those prescribed for other essential components (such as the steering linkage) of the vehicle. Any such part as aforesaid whose failure would make it impossible to brake the vehicle with a degree of effectiveness at least equal to that prescribed for secondary braking shall be made of metal or of a material with equivalent characteristics and shall not undergo notable distortion in normal operation of the braking systems.

5.2.3.

The failure of a part of a hydraulic transmission system shall be signalled to the driver by a device comprising a red tell-tale signal lighting up before or upon application of a differential pressure of not more than 15.5 bar between the active and failed brake equipment, measured at the master cylinder outlet and remaining lit as long as the failure persists and the ignition (start) switch is in the "On" (run) position. However, a device comprising a red tell-tale signal lighting up when the fluid in the reservoir is below a certain level specified by the manufacturer is permitted. The tell-tale signal shall be visible even by daylight; the satisfactory condition of the signal shall be easily verifiable by the driver from the driver's seat. The failure of a component of the device shall not entail total loss of the braking equipment's effectiveness.

Application of the parking brake shall also be indicated to the driver. The same tell-tale signal may be used.

5.2.4.

Where use is made of energy other than the muscular energy of the driver, there need not be more than one source of such energy (hydraulic pump, air compressor, etc.), but the means by which the device constituting that source is driven shall be as safe as practicable.

5.2.4.1.

In the event of failure in any part of the transmission of a braking system, the feed to the part not affected by the failure shall continue to be ensured if required for the purpose of halting the vehicle with the degree of effectiveness 11

Internal Use Only. Prepared on 09.02.2023.

UNECE R 13-H-01



prescribed for secondary braking. This condition shall be met by means of devices which can easily be actuated when the vehicle is stationary, or by automatic means.

5.2.4.2.

Furthermore, storage devices located down-circuit of this device shall be such that in the case of a failure in the energy supply after four full-stroke actuations of the service brake control, under the conditions prescribed in paragraph 1.2.

of Annex 4 to this Regulation, it is still possible to halt the vehicle at the fifth application, with the degree of effectiveness prescribed for secondary braking.

5.2.4.3.

However, for hydraulic braking systems with stored energy, these provisions can be considered to be met provided that the requirements of paragraph 1.3.

of Annex 4 to this Regulation, are satisfied.

5.2.5.

The requirements of paragraphs 5.2.2., 5.2.3. and 5.2.4. above shall be met without the use of any automatic device of a kind such that its ineffectiveness might pass unnoticed through the fact that parts normally in a position of rest come into action only in the event of failure in the braking system.

5.2.6.

The service braking system shall act on all wheels of the vehicle and shall distribute its action appropriately among the axles.

5.2.7.

In the case of vehicles equipped with electric regenerative braking systems of category B, the braking input from other sources of braking, may be suitably phased to allow the electric regenerative braking system alone to be applied, provided that both the following conditions are met:

5.2.7.1.

Intrinsic variations in the torque output of the electrical regenerative braking system (e.g. as a result of changes in the electric state of charge in the traction batteries) are automatically compensated by appropriate variation in the phasing relationship as long as the requirements3 of one of the following annexes to this Regulation are satisfied:



Annex 3, paragraph 1.3.2., or



Annex 6, paragraph 5.3. (including the case with the electric motor engaged), and



wherever necessary, to ensure that braking rate 3/ remains related to the driver's braking demand, having regard to the available tyre/road adhesion, braking shall automatically be caused to act on all wheels of the vehicle.

5.2.8.

The action of the service braking system shall be distributed between the wheels of one and the same axle symmetrically in relation to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle.



Compensation and functions, such as anti-lock, which may cause deviations from this symmetrical distribution shall be declared.

5.2.8.1.

Compensation by the electric control transmission for deterioration or defect within the braking system shall be indicated to the driver by means of the yellow warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.2. below. This requirement shall apply for all conditions of loading when compensation exceeds the following limits:





3 The Type Approval Authority, which is to grant approval, shall have the right to check the service braking system by additional vehicle test procedures.

5.2.8.2.

Compensation as defined above, is permitted only when the initial brake application is made at vehicle speeds greater than 10 km/h.

5.2.9.

Malfunctions of the electric control transmission shall not apply the brakes contrary to the driver's intentions.

5.2.10.

The service, secondary and parking braking systems shall act on braking surfaces connected to the wheels through components of adequate strength.



Where braking torque for a particular axle or axles is provided by both a friction braking system and an electrical regenerative braking system of category B, disconnection of the latter source is permitted, providing that the friction braking source remains permanently connected and able to provide the compensation referred to in paragraph 5.2.7.1. above.



However, in the case of short disconnection transients, incomplete compensation is accepted, but within 1s, this compensation shall have attained at least 75 per cent of its final value.

Nevertheless, in all cases, the permanently connected friction braking source shall ensure that both the service and secondary braking systems continue to operate with the prescribed degree of effectiveness.

Disconnection of the braking surfaces of the parking braking system shall be permitted only on condition that the disconnection is controlled by the driver from his driving seat or from a remote control device, by a system incapable of being brought into action by a leak.

The remote control device mentioned above shall be part of a system fulfilling the technical requirements of an ACSF of Category A as specified in the 02

series of amendments to UN Regulation No. 79 or later series of amendmentsk.

(updated according to Supplement 1 to the 01 series of amendments, date of entry into force: 29.12.2018)

5.2.11.

Wear of the brakes shall be capable of being easily taken up by means of a system of manual or automatic adjustment. In addition, the control and the components of the transmission and of the brakes shall possess a reserve of travel and, if necessary, suitable means of compensation such that, when the brakes become heated, or the brake linings have reached a certain degree of wear, effective braking is ensured without immediate adjustment being necessary.

5.2.11.1.

Wear adjustment shall be automatic for the service brakes. Automatic wear adjustment devices shall be such that after heating followed by cooling of the brakes, effective braking is still ensured. In particular the vehicle shall remain 13

UNECE R 13-H-01



capable of normal running after the tests conducted in accordance with Annex 3, paragraph 1.5. (Type-I test).

5.2.11.2.

Checking the wear of the service brake friction components 5.2.11.2.1.

It shall be possible to easily assess this wear on service brake linings from the outside or underside of the vehicle, without the removal of the wheels, by the provision of appropriate inspection holes or by some other means. This may be achieved by utilizing simple standard workshop tools or common inspection equipment for vehicles.



Alternatively, a sensing device per wheel (twin wheels are considered as a single wheel), which will warn the driver at his driving position when lining replacement is necessary, is acceptable. In the case of an optical warning, the yellow warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.2. below may be used.

5.2.11.2.2.

Assessment of the wear condition of the friction surfaces of brake discs or drums may only be performed by direct measurement of the actual component or examination of any brake disc or drum wear indicators, which may necessitate some level of disassembly. Therefore, at the time of type approval, the vehicle manufacturer shall define the following:

(a)

The method by which wear of the friction surfaces of drums and discs may be assessed, including the level of disassembly required and the tools and process required to achieve this;

(b)

Information defining the maximum acceptable wear limit at the point at which replacement becomes necessary.



This information shall be made freely available, e.g. vehicle handbook or electronic data record.

5.2.12.

In hydraulic-transmission braking systems, the filling ports of the fluid reservoirs shall be readily accessible; in addition, the receptacles containing the reserve fluid shall be so designed and constructed that the level of the reserve fluid can be easily checked without the receptacles having to be opened, and the minimum total reservoir capacity is equivalent to the fluid displacement resulting when all the wheel cylinders or calliper pistons serviced by the reservoirs move from a new lining, fully retracted position to a fully worn, fully applied position. If these latter conditions are not fulfilled, the red warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.1. below shall draw the driver's attention to any fall in the level of reserve fluid liable to cause a failure of the braking system.

5.2.13.

The type of fluid to be used in hydraulic transmission braking systems shall be identified by the symbol in accordance with Figure 1 or 2 of Standard ISO 9128:2006 and the appropriate DOT marking (e.g. DOT 3). The symbol and the marking shall be affixed in a visible position in indelible form within 100 mm of the filling ports of the fluid reservoirs; additional information may be provided by the manufacturer.

5.2.14.

Warning device

5.2.14.1.

Any vehicle fitted with a service brake actuated from an energy reservoir shall, where the prescribed secondary braking performance cannot be obtained by means of this brake without the use of the stored energy, be provided with a warning device, giving an optical or acoustic signal when the stored energy, in any part of the system, falls to a value at which without re-charging of the 14

UNECE R 13-H-01



reservoir and irrespective of the load conditions of the vehicle, it is possible to apply the service brake control a fifth time after four full-stroke actuations and obtain the prescribed secondary braking performance (without faults in the service brake transmission device and with the brakes adjusted as closely as possible). This warning device shall be directly and permanently connected to the circuit. When the engine is running under normal operating conditions and there are no faults in the braking system, as is the case in type approval tests, the warning device shall give no signal except during the time required for charging the energy reservoir(s) after start-up of the engine. The red warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.1. below shall be used as the optical warning signal.

5.2.14.2.

However, in the case of vehicles which are only considered to comply with the requirements of paragraph 5.2.4.1. of this Regulation by virtue of meeting the requirements of paragraph 1.3. of Annex 4 to this Regulation, the warning device shall consist of an acoustic signal in addition to an optical signal. These devices need not operate simultaneously, provided that each of them meets the above requirements and the acoustic signal is not actuated before the optical signal. The red warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.1. below shall be used as the optical warning signal.

5.2.14.3.

This acoustic device may be rendered inoperative while the parking brake is applied and/or, at the choice of the manufacturer, in the case of automatic transmission the selector is in the "Park" position.

5.2.15.

Without prejudice to the requirements of paragraph 5.1.2.3. above, where an auxiliary source of energy is essential to the functioning of a braking system, the reserve of energy shall be such as to ensure that, if the engine stops or in the event of a failure of the means by which the energy source is driven, the braking performance remains adequate to bring the vehicle to a halt in the prescribed conditions. In addition, if the muscular effort applied by the driver to the parking braking system is reinforced by a servo device, the actuation of parking braking shall be ensured in the event of a failure of the servo device, if necessary by using a reserve of energy independent of that normally supplying the servo device. This reserve of energy may be that intended for the service braking system.

5.2.16.

The pneumatic/hydraulic auxiliary equipment shall be supplied with energy in such a way that during its operation the prescribed deceleration values can be reached and that even in the event of damage to the source of energy the operation of the auxiliary equipment cannot cause the reserves of energy feeding the braking systems to fall below the level indicated in paragraph 5.2.14. above.

5.2.17.

In the case of a motor vehicle equipped to tow a trailer with electric service brakes, the following requirements shall be met:

5.2.17.1.

The power supply (generator and battery) of the motor vehicle shall have a sufficient capacity to provide the current for an electric braking system. With the engine running at the idling speed recommended by the manufacturer and all electrical devices supplied by the manufacturer as standard equipment of the vehicle switched on, the voltage in the electrical lines shall at maximum current consumption of the electrical braking system (15 A) not fall below the value of 9.6 V measured at the connection. The electrical lines shall not be capable of short circuiting even when overloaded;





15

UNECE R 13-H-01



5.2.17.2.

In the event of a failure in the motor vehicle's service braking system, where that system consists of at least two independent units, the unit or units not affected by the failure shall be capable of partially or fully actuating the brakes of the trailer;

5.2.17.3.

The use of the stop-lamp switch and circuit for actuating the electrical braking system is permissible only if the actuating line is connected in parallel with the stop-lamp and the existing stop-lamp switch and circuit are capable of taking the extra load.

5.2.18.

Additional requirements for vehicles equipped with electric regenerative braking systems.

5.2.18.1.

Vehicles fitted with an electric regenerative braking system of category A.

5.2.18.1.1.

The electric regenerative braking shall only be activated by the accelerator control and/or the gear neutral position.

5.2.18.2.

Vehicles fitted with an electric regenerative braking system of category B.

5.2.18.2.1.

It shall not be possible to disconnect, partially or totally, one part of the service braking system other than by automatic means. This should not be construed as a departure from the requirements of paragraph 5.2.10. above; 5.2.18.2.2.

The service braking system shall have only one control device; 5.2.18.2.3.

The service braking system shall not be adversely affected by the disengagement of the motor(s) or by the gear ratio used;

5.2.18.2.4.

If the operation of the electric component of braking is ensured by a relation established between information coming from the control of the service brake and the braking force to the wheels which of it results, a failure of this relation leading to the non-respect of the prescriptions of distribution of braking among the axles (Annex 5 or 6, which is applicable) shall be warned to the driver by an optical warning signal at the latest when the control is actuated and having to remain lit as long as this defect exists and that the switch of "contact" is in the position "Go".

5.2.18.3.

For vehicles fitted with an electric regenerative braking system of either category, all the relevant prescriptions shall apply except paragraph 5.2.18.1.1.

above. In this case, the electric regenerative braking may be actuated by the accelerator control and/or the gear neutral position. Additionally, the action on the service braking control shall not reduce the above braking effect generated by the release of the accelerator control.

5.2.18.4.

The operation of the electric braking shall not be adversely affected by magnetic or electric fields.

5.2.18.5.

For vehicles equipped with an anti-lock device, the anti-lock device shall control the electric braking system.

5.2.18.6.

The state of charge of the traction batteries is determined by the method set out in Appendix 1 to Annex 3 to this Regulation.4





4 By agreement with the Technical Service, state of charge assessment will not be required for vehicles, which have an on-board energy source for charging the traction batteries and the means for regulating their state of charge.

5.2.19.

Special additional requirements for the electric transmission of the parking braking system:

5.2.19.1.

In the case of a failure within the electric transmission, any unintended actuation of the parking braking system shall be prevented; 5.2.19.2.

In the case of an electrical failure in the control or a break in the wiring within the electric control transmission between the control and the ECU directly connected with it, excluding the energy supply, it shall remain possible to apply the parking braking system from the driver's seat and thereby be capable of holding the laden vehicle stationary on an 8 per cent up or down gradient.

Alternatively, in this case, an automatic actuation of the parking brake is allowed when the vehicle is stationary, provided that the above performance is achieved and, once applied, the parking brake remains engaged independently of the status of the ignition (start) switch. In this alternative, the parking brake shall be automatically released as soon as the driver starts to set the vehicle in motion again. The engine/manual transmission or the automatic transmission (park position) may be used to achieve or assist in achieving the above performance.

5.2.19.2.1.

A break in the wiring within the electrical transmission, or an electrical failure in the control of the parking braking system shall be signalled to the driver by the yellow warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.2. When caused by a break in the wiring within the electrical control transmission of the parking braking system, this yellow warning signal shall be signalled as soon as the break occurs.



In addition, such an electrical failure in the control or break in the wiring external to the electronic control unit(s) and excluding the energy supply shall be signalled to the driver by flashing the red warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.1. as long as the ignition (start) switch is in the "On" (run) position including a period of not less than 10 seconds thereafter and the control is in the "On" (activated) position.



However, if the parking braking system detects correct clamping of the parking brake, the flashing of the red warning signal may be suppressed and the non-flashing red signal shall be used to indicate "parking brake applied".



Where actuation of the parking brake is normally indicated by a separate red warning signal, satisfying all the requirements of paragraph 5.2.21.2. below, this signal shall be used to satisfy the above requirement for a red signal.

5.2.19.3.

Auxiliary equipment may be supplied with energy from the electric transmission of the parking braking system provided that the supply of energy is sufficient to allow the actuation of the parking braking system in addition to the vehicle electrical load under non-fault conditions. In addition, where the energy reserve is also used by the service braking system, the requirements of paragraph 5.2.20.6. below shall apply.

5.2.19.4.

After the ignition/start switch which controls the electrical energy for the braking equipment has been switched off and/or the key removed, it shall remain possible to apply the parking braking system, whereas releasing shall be prevented.

However, the parking braking system may also be released when this action is part of an operation of a remote control system fulfilling the technical 17

UNECE R 13-H-01



requirements of an ACSF of Category A as specified in the 02 series of amendments to UN Regulation No. 79 or later series of amendments.

(updated according to Supplement 1 to the 01 series of amendments, date of entry into force: 29.12.2018)



5.2.20.

Special additional requirements for service braking systems with electric control transmission:

5.2.20.1.

With the parking brake released, the service braking system shall be able to fulfil the following requirements:

(a)

With the propulsion system on/off control in the ''On'' (''Run'') position, generate a static total braking force at least equivalent to that required by the Type-0 test for service braking performance as prescribed in paragraph 2.1. of Annex 3 to this Regulation;

(b)

During the first 60 seconds after the propulsion system on/off control has been deactivated to the ''Off'' or ''Lock'' position and/or the ignition key has been removed, three brake applications shall generate a static total braking force at least equivalent to that required by the Type-0 test for service braking performance as prescribed in paragraph 2.1. of Annex 3 to this Regulation; and

(c)

After the period mentioned above, or as from the fourth brake application within the 60 second period, whichever occurs first, generate a static total braking force at least equivalent to that required by the Type-0 test for secondary braking performance as prescribed in paragraph 2.2. of Annex 3 to this Regulation.



It should be understood that sufficient energy is available in the energy transmission of the service braking system.

5.2.20.2.

In the case of a single temporary failure ( 40 ms) within the electric control transmission, excluding its energy supply, (e.g. non-transmitted signal or data error) there shall be no distinguishable effect on the service braking performance.

5.2.20.3.

A failure within the electric control transmission,5 not including its energy reserve, that affects the function and performance of systems addressed in this Regulation shall be indicated to the driver by the red or yellow warning signal specified in paragraphs 5.2.21.1.1. and 5.2.21.1.2. below, respectively, as appropriate. When the prescribed service braking performance can no longer be achieved (red warning signal), failures resulting from a loss of electrical continuity (e.g. breakage, disconnection) shall be signalled to the driver as soon as they occur, and the prescribed secondary braking performance shall be fulfilled by operating the service braking control in accordance with paragraph 2.2. of Annex 3 to this Regulation.

5.2.20.4.

In the event of a failure of the energy source of the electric control transmission, starting from the nominal value of the energy level, the full 5 Until uniform test procedures have been agreed, the manufacturer shall provide the Technical Service with an analysis of potential failures within the control transmission and their effects. This information shall be subject to discussion and agreement between the Technical Service and the vehicle manufacturer.

UNECE R 13-H-01



control range of the service braking system shall be guaranteed after twenty consecutive full stroke actuations of the service braking control. During the test, the braking control shall be fully applied for 20 seconds and released for 5 seconds on each actuation. It should be understood that during the above test sufficient energy is available in the energy transmission to ensure full actuation of the service braking system. This requirement shall not be construed as a departure from the requirements of Annex 4.

5.2.20.5.

When the battery voltage falls below a value nominated by the manufacturer at which the prescribed service braking performance can no longer be guaranteed and/or which precludes at least two independent service braking circuits from each achieving the prescribed secondary braking performance, the red warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.1. below shall be activated. After the warning signal has been activated, it shall be possible to apply the service braking control and obtain at least the secondary performance prescribed in paragraph 2.2. of Annex 3 to this Regulation. It should be understood that sufficient energy is available in the energy transmission of the service braking system.

5.2.20.6.

If auxiliary equipment is supplied with energy from the same reserve as the electric control transmission, it shall be ensured that, with the engine running at a speed not greater than 80 per cent of the maximum power speed, the supply of energy is sufficient to fulfil the prescribed deceleration values by either provision of an energy supply which is able to prevent discharge of this reserve when all auxiliary equipment is functioning or by automatically switching off pre-selected parts of the auxiliary equipment at a voltage above the critical level referred to in paragraph 5.2.20.5. above of this Regulation such that further discharge of this reserve is prevented. Compliance may be demonstrated by calculation or by a practical test. This paragraph does not apply to vehicles where the prescribed deceleration values can be reached without the use of electrical energy.

5.2.20.7.

If the auxiliary equipment is supplied with energy from the electric control transmission, the following requirements shall be fulfilled: 5.2.20.7.1.

In the event of a failure in the energy source, whilst the vehicle is in motion, the energy in the reservoir shall be sufficient to actuate the brakes when the control is applied;

5.2.20.7.2.

In the event of a failure in the energy source, whilst the vehicle is stationary and the parking braking system applied, the energy in the reservoir shall be sufficient to actuate the lights even when the brakes are applied.

5.2.21.

The general requirements for optical warning signals whose function is to indicate to the driver certain specified failures (or defects) within the braking equipment of the motor vehicle, are set out in the following sub-paragraphs.

Other than as described in paragraph 5.2.21.5. below, these signals shall be used exclusively for the purposes prescribed by this Regulation.

5.2.21.1.

Motor vehicles shall be capable of providing optical brake failure and defect warning signals, as follows:

5.2.21.1.1.

A red warning signal, indicating failures defined elsewhere in this Regulation within the vehicle braking equipment which preclude achievement of the prescribed service braking performance and/or which preclude the functioning of at least one of two independent service braking circuits; 19

Where applicable, a yellow warning signal indicating an electrically detected defect within the vehicle braking equipment, which is not indicated by the red warning signal described in paragraph 5.2.21.1.1. above.

5.2.21.2.

The warning signals shall be visible, even by daylight; the satisfactory condition of the signals shall be easily verifiable by the driver from the driver's seat; the failure of a component of the warning devices shall not entail any loss of the braking system's performance.

5.2.21.3.

Except where stated otherwise:

5.2.21.3.1.

A specified failure or defect shall be signalled to the driver by the above-mentioned warning signal(s) not later than on actuation of the relevant braking control;

5.2.21.3.2.

The warning signal(s) shall remain displayed as long as the failure/defect persists and the ignition (start) switch is in the "On" (run) position; and 5.2.21.3.3.

The warning signal shall be constant (not flashing).

5.2.21.4.

The warning signal(s) mentioned above shall light up when the electrical equipment of the vehicle (and the braking system) is energised. With the vehicle stationary, the braking system shall verify that none of the specified failures or defects are present before extinguishing the signals. Specified failures or defects which should activate the warning signals mentioned above, but which are not detected under static conditions, shall be stored upon detection and be displayed at start-up and at all times when the ignition (start) switch is in the "On" (run) position, as long as the failure or defect persists.

5.2.21.5.

Non specified failures (or defects), or other information concerning the brakes and/or running gear of the power-driven vehicle, may be indicated by the yellow signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.2. above, provided that all the following conditions are fulfilled:

5.2.21.5.1.

The vehicle is stationary;

5.2.21.5.2.

After the braking equipment is first energised and the signal has indicated that, following the procedures detailed in paragraph 5.2.21.4. above, no specified failures (or defects) have been identified; and

5.2.21.5.3.

Non-specified faults or other information shall be indicated only by the flashing of the warning signal. However, the warning signal shall be extinguished by the time when the vehicle first exceeds 10 km/h.

5.2.22.

Generation of a braking signal to illuminate stop lamps.

5.2.22.1.

Activation of the service braking system by the driver shall generate a signal that will be used to illuminate the stop lamps.

6 At the time of type approval, compliance with this requirement shall be confirmed by the vehicle manufacturer.

Once generated, the signal shall be kept as long as a deceleration demand persists. However, the signal may be suppressed at standstill or when the deceleration demand falls below 1.3 m/s² or that value which generated the signal, whichever is lower.

An appropriate measure (e.g. switch-off-hysteresis, averaging, time delay) shall be implemented in order to avoid fast changes of the signal resulting in flickering of the stop lamps.

(updated according to Supplement 4 to the 01 series of amendments, date of entry into force: 4 January 2023)

5.2.22.3.

Activation of part of the service braking system by "selective braking" or by functions whose primary intention is not to decelerate the vehicle (e.g. slight actuation of the friction brakes to clean the discs) shall not generate the signal mentioned above.6

5.2.22.4.

The signal shall not be generated when retardation is solely produced by the natural braking effect of the engine, air-/rolling resistance and/or road slope.

5.2.23.1.

The signal shall not be activated when the vehicle deceleration is below 6 m/s²

but it may be generated at any deceleration at or above this value, the actual value being defined by the vehicle manufacturer.



The signal shall be de-activated at the latest when the deceleration has fallen below 2.5 m/s².

5.2.23.2.

The following conditions may also be used:

(a)

The signal may be generated from a prediction of the vehicle deceleration resulting from the braking demand respecting the activation and de-activation thresholds defined in paragraph 5.2.23.1.

above;



or

(b)

The signal may be activated at a speed above 50 km/h when the antilock system is fully cycling (as defined in paragraph 2. of Annex 6).



The signal shall be deactivated when the antilock system is no longer fully cycling.

5.2.24.

Power-driven vehicles of category M1 and N1 equipped with temporary-use spare wheels/tyres shall satisfy the relevant technical requirements of Annex 3

Annex 3




Braking tests and performance of braking systems

1.

Braking tests

1.1.

General

1.1.1.

The performance prescribed for braking systems is based on the stopping distance and the mean fully developed deceleration. The performance of a braking system shall be determined by measuring the stopping distance in relation to the initial speed of the vehicle and/or by measuring the mean fully developed deceleration during the test.

1.1.2.

The stopping distance shall be the distance covered by the vehicle from the moment when the driver begins to actuate the control of the braking system until the moment when the vehicle stops; the initial speed shall be the speed at the moment when the driver begins to actuate the control of the braking system; the initial speed shall not be less than 98 per cent of the prescribed speed for the test in question.



The mean fully developed deceleration (dm) shall be calculated as the deceleration averaged with respect to distance over the interval vb to ve , according to the following formula:

v2 - v2

d

=

b

e

m

25.92 (s - s )

e

b





Where:



vo

=

initial vehicle speed in km/h,



vb

=

vehicle speed at 0.8 vo in km/h,



ve

=

vehicle speed at 0.1 vo in km/h,



sb

=

distance travelled between vo and vb in metres,



se

=

distance travelled between vo and ve in metres.



The speed and distance shall be determined using instrumentation having an accuracy of ±1 per cent at the prescribed speed for the test. The dm may be determined by other methods than the measurement of speed and distance; in this case, the accuracy of the dm shall be within ±3 per cent.

1.2.

For the approval of any vehicle, the braking performance shall be measured during road tests conducted in the following conditions:

1.2.1.

The vehicle's condition as regards mass shall be as prescribed for each type of test and be specified in the test report;

1.2.2.

The test shall be carried out at the speeds prescribed for each type of test; if the maximum design speed of a vehicle is lower than the speed prescribed for a test, the test shall be performed at the vehicle's maximum speed; 1.2.3.

During the tests, the force applied to the brake control in order to obtain the prescribed performance shall not exceed the maximum force laid down; 30

Internal Use Only. Prepared on 09.02.2023.

UNECE R 13-H-01



1.2.4.

The road shall have a surface affording good adhesion, unless specified otherwise in the relevant annexes;

1.2.5.

The tests shall be performed when there is no wind liable to affect the results; 1.2.6.

At the start of the tests, the tyres shall be cold and at the pressure prescribed for the load actually borne by the wheels when the vehicle is stationary; 1.2.7.

The prescribed performance shall be obtained without locking of the wheels at speeds exceeding 15 km/h, without deviation of the vehicle from a 3.5 m wide lane, without exceeding a yaw angle of 15° and without abnormal vibrations; 1.2.8.

For vehicles powered completely or partially by an electric motor (or motors), permanently connected to the wheels, all tests shall be carried out with these motor(s) connected;

1.2.9.

For vehicles as described in paragraph 1.2.8. above, fitted with an electric regenerative braking system of category A, behaviour tests shall be carried out on a track with a low adhesion coefficient (as defined in paragraph 5.2.2. of Annex 6) at a speed equal to 80 per cent of the maximum speed but not exceeding 120 km/h, to check that stability is retained.

1.2.9.1.

Moreover, for vehicles fitted with an electric regenerative braking system of category A, transient conditions as gear changes or accelerator control release shall not affect the behaviour of the vehicle in condition described in paragraph 1.2.9. above;

1.2.10.

In the tests provided in paragraphs 1.2.9. and 1.2.9.1. above wheel locking is not allowed. However, steering correction is permitted if the angular rotation of the steering control is within 120° during the initial 2 seconds and not more than 240° in all;

1.2.11.

For a vehicle with electrically actuated service brakes powered from traction batteries (or an auxiliary battery) which receive(s) energy only from an independent external charging system, these batteries shall, during braking performance testing, be at an average of not more than 5 per cent above that state of charge at which the brake failure warning prescribed in paragraph 5.2.20.5. of this Regulation is required to be given.



If this warning is given, the batteries may receive some recharge during the tests, to keep them in the required state of charge range.

1.3.

Behaviour of the vehicle during braking

1.3.1.

In braking tests, and in particular in those at high speed, the general behaviour of the vehicle during braking shall be checked.

1.3.2.

Behaviour of the vehicle during braking on a road on which adhesion is reduced shall meet the relevant requirements of Annex 5 and/or Annex 6 to this Regulation.

1.3.2.1.

In the case of a braking system according to paragraph 5.2.7. of this Regulation where the braking for a particular axle (or axles) is comprised of more than one source of braking torque, and any individual source can be varied with respect to the other(s), the vehicle shall satisfy the requirements of Annex 5, or alternatively, Annex 6 under all relationships permitted by its control strategy.1

1.4.

Type-0 test (ordinary performance test with cold brakes)

1.4.1.

General

1.4.1.1.

The average temperature of the service brakes on the hottest axle of the vehicle, measured inside the brake linings or on the braking path of the disc or drum, is between 65 and 100 °C prior to any brake application.

1.4.1.2.

The test shall be conducted in the following conditions:

1.4.1.2.1.

The vehicle shall be laden, the distribution of its mass among the axles being that stated by the manufacturer; where provision is made for several arrangements of the load on the axles the distribution of the maximum mass among the axles shall be such that the mass on each axle is proportional to the maximum permissible mass for each axle;

1.4.1.2.2.

Every test shall be repeated on the unladen vehicle; there may be, in addition to the driver, a second person on the front seat who is responsible for noting the results of the test;

1.4.1.2.3.

In the case of a vehicle equipped with an electric regenerative braking system, the requirements depend on the category of this system:



Category A. Any separate electric regenerative braking control which is provided, shall not be used during the Type-0 tests.



Category B. The contribution of the electric regenerative braking system to the braking force generated shall not exceed that minimum level guaranteed by the system design.

This condition is deemed to be satisfied if the state of charge of the batteries is in one of the following conditions:

(a)

At the maximum charge level recommended by the manufacturer, as listed in the vehicle specification;

(b)

At a level not less than 95 per cent of the full charge level, where the manufacturer has made no specific recommendation;

(c)

At a maximum level resulting from automatic charge control on the vehicle; or

(d)

When the tests are conducted without a regenerative braking component regardless of the state of charge of the batteries.

1.4.1.2.4.

The limits prescribed for minimum performance, both for tests with the vehicle unladen and for tests with the vehicle laden, shall be those laid down hereunder; the vehicle shall satisfy both the prescribed stopping distance and the prescribed mean fully developed deceleration, but it may not be necessary to actually measure both parameters;





1 The manufacturer shall provide the Technical Service with the family of braking curves permitted by the automatic control strategy. These curves may be verified by the Technical Service.

1.4.1.2.5.

The road shall be level; unless otherwise specified each test may comprise up to six stops including any needed for familiarization.

1.4.2.

Type-0 test with engine disconnected, service braking in accordance with paragraph 2.1.1.(A) of this annex.



The test shall be carried out at the speed prescribed, the figures prescribed in this connection being subject to a certain margin of tolerance. The minimum performance prescribed shall be attained.

1.4.3.

Type-0 test with engine connected, service braking in accordance with paragraph 2.1.1.(B) of this annex.

1.4.3.1.

The test shall be carried out with the engine connected, from the speed prescribed in paragraph 2.1.1.(B) of this annex. The minimum performance prescribed shall be attained. This test is not run if the maximum speed of the vehicle is  125 km/h.

1.4.3.2.

The maximum practical performance figures shall be measured, and the behaviour of the vehicle shall be in accordance with paragraph 1.3.2. of this annex. However, if the maximum speed of the vehicle is greater than 200 km/h, the test speed shall be 160 km/h.

1.5.

Type-I test (fade and recovery test)

1.5.1.

Heating procedure

1.5.1.1.

The service brakes of all vehicles shall be tested by successively applying and releasing the brakes a number of times, the vehicle being laden, in the conditions shown in the table below:

UNECE R 13-H-01



1.5.1.3.

In these tests, the force applied to the control shall be so adjusted as to attain a mean deceleration of 3 m/s2 during every brake application; two preliminary tests may be carried out to determine the appropriate control force.

1.5.1.4.

During brake applications, the highest gear ratio (excluding overdrive, etc.) shall be continuously engaged.

1.5.1.5.

For regaining speed after braking, the gearbox shall be used in such a way as to attain the speed v1 in the shortest possible time (maximum acceleration allowed by the engine and gearbox).

1.5.1.6.

For vehicles not having sufficient autonomy to carry out the cycles of heating of the brakes, the tests shall be carried out by achieving the prescribed speed before the first braking application and thereafter by using the maximum acceleration available to regain speed and then braking successively at the speed reached at the end of each 45 second cycle duration.

1.5.1.7.

For vehicles equipped with an electric regenerative braking system of category B, the condition of the vehicle batteries at the start of the test, shall be such that the braking force contribution provided by the electric regenerative braking system does not exceed the minimum guaranteed by the system design. This requirement is deemed to be satisfied if the batteries are at one of the state of charge conditions as listed in paragraph 1.4.1.2.3. above.

1.5.2.

Hot performance

1.5.2.1.

At the end of the Type-I test (described in paragraph 1.5.1. of this annex) the hot performance of the service braking system shall be measured in the same conditions (and in particular at a mean control force no greater than the mean force actually used) as for the Type-0 test with the engine disconnected (the temperature conditions may be different).

1.5.2.2.

This hot performance shall not be less than 752 per cent of that prescribed, nor less than 60 per cent of the figure recorded in the Type-0 test with the engine disconnected.

1.5.2.3.

For vehicles fitted with an electric regenerative braking system of category A, during brake applications, the highest gear shall be continuously engaged and the separate electric braking control, if any, not used.

1.5.2.4.

In the case of vehicles equipped with an electric regenerative braking system of category B, having carried out the heating cycles according to paragraph 1.5.1.6. of this annex, the hot performance test shall be carried out at the maximum speed which can be reached by the vehicle at the end of the brake heating cycles, unless the speed specified in paragraph 2.1.1.(A) of this annex can be reached.



For comparison, a later Type-0 test with cold brakes shall be repeated from this same speed and with a similar electric regenerative braking contribution, as set by an appropriate state of battery charge, as was available during the hot performance test.



Following the recovery process and test, further reconditioning of the linings shall be permitted before the test is made to compare this second cold 2 This corresponds to a stopping distance of 0.1 v + 0.0080 v2 and a mean fully developed deceleration of 4.82 m/s2.

performance with that achieved in the hot test, against the criteria of paragraphs 1.5.2.2. or 1.5.2.5. of this annex.

The tests may be conducted without a regenerative braking component. In this case, the requirement on the state of charge of the batteries is not applicable.

1.5.2.5.

In the case of a vehicle which satisfies the 60 per cent requirement specified in paragraph 1.5.2.2. of this annex, but which cannot comply with the 752 per cent requirement of paragraph 1.5.2.2. of this annex, a further hot performance test may be carried out using a control force not exceeding that specified in paragraph 2. of this annex. The results of both tests shall be entered in the report.

1.5.3.

Recovery procedure



Immediately after the hot performance test, make four stops from 50 km/h with the engine connected, at a mean deceleration of 3 m/s2. Allow an interval of 1.5 km between the start of successive stops. Immediately after each stop, accelerate at maximum rate to 50 km/h and maintain that speed until making the next stop.

1.5.3.1.

Vehicles equipped with an electrical regenerative braking system of Category B may have their batteries recharged or replaced by a charged set. In this case, further reconditioning of the linings shall be performed in order to complete the recovery procedure.



The procedures may be conducted without a regenerative braking component.

(updated according to Supplement 2 to the 01 series of amendments, date of entry into force: 30.09.2021)

1.5.4.

Recovery performance



At the end of the recovery procedure, the recovery performance of the service braking system shall be measured in the same conditions as for the Type-0 test with the engine disconnected (the temperature conditions may be different), using a mean force on the control, which is not more than the mean control force used in the corresponding Type-0 test.



This recovery performance shall not be less than 70 per cent, nor more than 150 per cent, of the figure recorded in the Type-0 test with the engine disconnected.

1.5.4.1.

For vehicles equipped with an electrical regenerative braking system of category B, the recovery test shall be made with no regenerative braking component, i.e. under the conditions of paragraph 1.5.4. above.



After the further reconditioning of the linings, a second repeat Type-0 test shall be made from the same speed and with no electric regenerative braking contribution as in the recovery test with the engine/motors disconnected, and comparison shall be made between these test results.



The recovery performance shall not be less than 70 per cent, nor more than 150 per cent of the figure recorded in this final repeat Type-0 test.

Annex 3 - Appendix



Procedure for monitoring the state of battery charge



This procedure is applicable to vehicle batteries used for traction and regenerative braking.



The procedure requires the use of a bi-directional DC Watt-hour meter or a bi-directional DC Ampere-hour meter.



Procedure

1.1.

If the batteries are new or have been subject to extended storage, they shall be cycled as recommended by the manufacturer. A minimum 8-hour soak period at ambient temperature shall be allowed after completion of cycling.

1.2.

A full charge shall be established using the manufacturer's recommended charging procedure.

1.3.

When the braking tests of paragraphs 1.2.11., 1.4.1.2.3., 1.5.1.6., 1.5.1.7. and 1.5.2.4. of Annex 3 are conducted the watt-hours consumed by the traction motors and supplied by the regenerative braking system shall be recorded as a running total which shall then be used to determine the state of charge existing at the beginning or end of a particular test.

1.4.

To replicate a level of state of charge in the batteries for comparative tests, such as those of paragraph 1.5.2.4. of Annex 3, the batteries shall be either recharged to that level or charged to above that level and discharged into a fixed load at approximately constant power until the required state of charge is reached. Alternatively, for vehicles with battery powered electric traction only, the state of charge may be adjusted by running the vehicle. Tests conducted with a battery partially charged at their start shall be commenced as soon as possible after the desired state of charge has been reached.

Annex 6




Test requirements for vehicles fitted with anti-lock systems 1.

General

1.1.

This annex defines the required braking performance for road vehicles fitted with anti-lock systems.

1.2.

The anti-lock systems known at present comprise a sensor or sensors, a controller or controllers and a modulator or modulators. Any device of a different design which may be introduced in the future, or where an anti-lock braking function is integrated into another system, shall be deemed to be an anti-lock braking system within the meaning of this annex and Annex 5 to this Regulation, if it provides performance equal to that prescribed by this annex.

2.

Definitions

2.1.

An " anti-lock system" is a part of a service braking system which automatically controls the degree of slip, in the direction of rotation of the wheel(s), on one or more wheels of the vehicle during braking.

2.2.

" Sensor" means a component designed to identify and transmit to the controller the conditions of rotation of the wheel(s) or the dynamic conditions of the vehicle.

2.3.

" Controller" means a component designed to evaluate the data transmitted by the sensor(s) and to transmit a signal to the modulator.

2.4.

" Modulator" means a component designed to vary the braking force(s) in accordance with the signal received from the controller.

2.5.

" Directly controlled wheel" means a wheel whose braking force is modulated according to data provided at least by its own sensor.1

2.6.

" Indirectly controlled wheel" means a wheel whose braking force is modulated according to data provided by the sensor(s) of other wheel(s).1

2.7.

" Full cycling" means that the anti-lock system is repeatedly modulating the brake force to prevent the directly controlled wheels from locking. Brake applications where modulation only occurs once during the stop shall not be considered to meet this definition.

3.

Types of anti-lock systems

3.1.

A vehicle is deemed to be equipped with an anti-lock system within the meaning of paragraph 1. of Annex 5 to this Regulation, if one of the following systems is fitted:





1 Anti-lock systems with select-high control are deemed to include both directly and indirectly controlled wheels; in systems with select-low control, all sensed wheels are deemed to be directly controlled wheels.





49

UNECE R 13-H-01



3.1.1.

Category 1 anti-lock system



A vehicle equipped with a category 1 anti-lock system shall meet all the requirements of this annex.

3.1.2.

Category 2 anti-lock system



A vehicle equipped with a category 2 anti-lock system shall meet all the requirements of this annex, except those of paragraph 5.3.5. below.

3.1.3.

Category 3 anti-lock system



A vehicle equipped with a category 3 anti-lock system shall meet all the requirements of this annex, except those of paragraphs 5.3.4. and 5.3.5. below.

On such vehicles, any individual axle which does not include at least one directly controlled wheel shall fulfil the conditions of adhesion utilization and the wheel-locking sequence of Annex 5 to this Regulation, instead of the adhesion utilization requirements prescribed in paragraph 5.2. of this annex.

However, if the relative positions of the adhesion utilization curves do not meet the requirements of paragraph 3.1. of Annex 5 to this Regulation, a check shall be made to ensure that the wheels on at least one of the rear axles do not lock before those of the front axle or axles under the conditions prescribed in paragraph 3.1. of Annex 5 to this Regulation, with regard to the braking rate and the load respectively. These requirements may be checked on high- and low-adhesion road surfaces (about 0.8 and 0.3 maximum) by modulating the service braking control force.

4.

General requirements

4.1.

Any electrical failure or sensor anomaly that affects the system with respect to the functional and performance requirements in this annex, including those in the supply of electricity, the external wiring to the controller(s), the controller(s)2 and the modulator(s) shall be signalled to the driver by a specific optical warning signal. The yellow warning signal specified in paragraph 5.2.21.1.2. of this Regulation shall be used for this purpose.

4.1.1.

Sensor anomalies, which cannot be detected under static conditions, shall be detected not later than when the vehicle speed exceed 10 km/h.3 However, to prevent erroneous fault indication when a sensor is not generating a vehicle speed output, due to non-rotation of a wheel, verification may be delayed but detected not later than when the vehicle speed exceeds 15 km/h.

4.1.2.

When the anti-lock braking system is energized with the vehicle stationary, electrically controlled pneumatic modulator valve(s) shall cycle at least once.

4.2.

In the event of a single electrical functional failure which only affects the antilock function, as indicated by the above-mentioned yellow warning signal, the subsequent service braking performance shall not be less than 80 per cent of the prescribed performance according to the Type-0 test with the engine disconnected. This corresponds to a stopping distance of 0.1 v + 0.0075 v2 (m) and a mean fully developed deceleration of 5.15 m/s2.





2 The manufacturer shall provide the Technical Service with documentation relating to the controller(s) which follows the format set out in Annex 8.



3 The warning signal may light up again while the vehicle is stationary, provided that it is extinguished before the vehicle speed reaches 10 km/h or 15 km/h, as appropriate, when no defect is present.

5.1.1.2.

From an initial speed of not less than 50 km/h, on a surface with a coefficient of adhesion of 0.35 or less, the brakes of the laden vehicle shall be fully applied for a time t, during which time the energy consumed by the indirectly controlled wheels shall be taken into consideration and all directly controlled wheels shall remain under control of the anti-lock system.

5.1.1.3.

The vehicle's engine shall then be stopped or the supply to the energy transmission storage device(s) cut off.

5.1.1.4.

The service braking control shall then be fully actuated four times in succession with the vehicle stationary.

(but not less than 15 seconds)



where t is expressed in seconds and vmax represents the maximum design speed of the vehicle expressed in km/h, with an upper limit of 160 km/h.

5.1.2.4.

If the time t cannot be completed in a single braking phase, further phases may be used, up to a maximum of four in all.

5.1.2.5.

If the test is conducted in several phases, no fresh energy shall be supplied between the phases of the test.



From the second phase, the energy consumption corresponding to the initial brake application may be taken into account, by subtracting one full brake application from the four full applications prescribed in paragraph 5.1.1.4. (and 5.1.1.5. and 5.1.2.6.) of this annex for each of the second, third and fourth phases used in the test prescribed in paragraph 5.1.1. of this annex as applicable.

5.1.2.6.

The performance prescribed in paragraph 5.1.1.5. of this annex shall be deemed to be satisfied if, at the end of the fourth application, with the vehicle stationary, the energy level in the storage device(s) is at or above that required for secondary braking with the laden vehicle.

5.2.

Utilization of adhesion

5.2.1.

The utilization of adhesion by the anti-lock system takes into account the actual increase in braking distance beyond the theoretical minimum. The anti-lock system shall be deemed to be satisfactory when the condition ε ≥ 0.75 is satisfied, where ε represents the adhesion utilized, as defined in paragraph 1.2.

of Appendix 2 to this annex.

5.2.2.

The adhesion utilization  shall be measured on road surfaces with a coefficient of adhesion of 0.35 or less, and of about 0.8 (dry road), with an initial speed of 50 km/h. To eliminate the effects of differential brake temperatures it is recommended that zAL be determined prior to the determination of k.

5.2.3.

The test procedure to determine the coefficient of adhesion (k) and the formulae for calculation of the adhesion utilization () shall be those laid down in Appendix 2 to this annex.

5.2.4.

The utilization of adhesion by the anti-lock system shall be checked on complete vehicles equipped with anti-lock systems of categories 1 or 2. In the case of vehicles equipped with category 3 anti-lock systems, only the axle(s) with at least one directly controlled wheel shall satisfy this requirement.

5.2.5.

The condition   0.75 shall be checked with the vehicle both laden and unladen.6





6 Until a uniform test procedure is established, the tests required by this paragraph may have to be repeated for vehicles equipped with electrical regenerative braking systems, in order to determine the effect of different braking distribution values provided by automatic functions on the vehicle.

The laden test on the high adhesion surface may be omitted if the prescribed force on the control device does not achieve full cycling of the anti-lock system.



For the unladen test, the control force may be increased up to 100 daN if no cycling is achieved with its full force value.7 If 100 daN is insufficient to make the system cycle, then this test may be omitted.

5.3.

Additional checks



The following additional checks shall be carried out with the engine disconnected, with the vehicle laden and unladen:

5.3.1.

The wheels directly controlled by an anti-lock system shall not lock when the full force7 is suddenly applied on the control device, on the road surfaces specified in paragraph 5.2.2. of this annex, at an initial speed of v = 40 km/h and at a high initial speed v = 0.8 vmax  120 km/h;8

5.3.2.

When an axle passes from a high-adhesion surface (kH) to a low-adhesion surface (kL), where kH  0.5 and kH / kL  2,9 with the full force7 applied on the control device, the directly controlled wheels shall not lock. The running speed and the instant of applying the brakes shall be so calculated that, with the anti-lock system fully cycling on the high-adhesion surface, the passage from one surface to the other is made at high and at low speed, under the conditions laid down in paragraph 5.3.1.;8

5.3.3.

When a vehicle passes from a low-adhesion surface (kL) to a high-adhesion surface (kH) where kH  0.5 and kH / kL  2,9 with the full force7 applied on the control device, the deceleration of the vehicle shall rise to the appropriate high value within a reasonable time and the vehicle shall not deviate from its initial course. The running speed and the instant of applying the brake shall be so calculated that, with the anti-lock system fully cycling on the low-adhesion surface, the passage from one surface to the other occurs at approximately 50 km/h;

5.3.4.

The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply to vehicles equipped with anti-lock systems of categories 1 or 2. When the right and left wheels of the vehicle are situated on surfaces with differing coefficients of adhesion (kH and kL), where kH  0.5 and kH / kL  2,9 the directly controlled wheels shall not lock when the full force7 is suddenly applied on the control device at a speed of 50 km/h;

5.3.5.

Furthermore, laden vehicles equipped with anti-lock systems of category 1

shall, under the conditions of paragraph 5.3.4. of this annex satisfy the prescribed braking rate in Appendix 3 to this annex;

5.3.6.

However, in the tests provided in paragraphs 5.3.1., 5.3.2., 5.3.3., 5.3.4. and 5.3.5. of this annex, brief periods of wheel-locking shall be allowed.





7 " Full force" means the maximum force laid down in Annex 3 to this Regulation; a higher force may be used if required to activate the anti-lock system.



8 The purpose of these tests is to check that the wheels do not lock and that the vehicle remains stable; it is not necessary, therefore, to make complete stops and bring the vehicle to a halt on the low-adhesion surface.



9 kH is the high-adhesion surface coefficient



kL is the low-adhesion surface coefficient



kH and kL are measured as laid down in Appendix 2 to this annex.

Furthermore, wheel-locking is permitted when the vehicle speed is less than 15

km/h; likewise, locking of indirectly controlled wheels is permitted at any speed, but stability and steerability shall not be affected and the vehicle shall not exceed a yaw angle of 15° or deviate from a 3.5 m wide lane; 5.3.7.

During the tests provided in paragraphs 5.3.4. and 5.3.5. of this annex, steering correction is permitted, if the angular rotation of the steering control is within 120° during the initial 2 seconds, and not more than 240° in all. Furthermore, at the beginning of these tests the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle shall pass over the boundary between the high- and low-adhesion surfaces and during these tests no part of the outer tyres shall cross this boundary.6

Utilisation of adhesion


1.

Method of measurement

1.1.

Determination of the coefficient of adhesion (k)

1.1.1.

The coefficient of adhesion (k) shall be determined as the quotient of the maximum braking forces without locking the wheels and the corresponding dynamic load on the axle being brakes.

1.1.2.

The brakes shall be applied on only one axle of the vehicle under test, at an initial speed of 50 km/h. The braking forces shall be distributed between the wheels of the axle to reach maximum performance. The anti-lock system shall be disconnected, or inoperative, between 40 km/h and 20 km/h.

1.1.3.

A number of tests at increments of line pressure shall be carried out to determine the maximum braking rate of the vehicle (zmax). During each test, a constant input force shall be maintained and the braking rate will be determined by reference to the time taken (t) for the speed to reduce from 40

km/h to 20 km/h using the formula:

0.566

z =

t





zmax is the maximum value of z; t is in seconds.

1.1.3.1.

Wheel lock may occur below 20 km/h.

1.1.3.2.

Starting from the minimum measured value of t, called tmin , then select three values of t comprised within tmin and 1.05 tmin and calculate their arithmetical mean value tm ,

0.566

z

=

m

t

then calculate:

m





If it is demonstrated that for practical reasons the three values defined above cannot be obtained, then the minimum time tmin may be utilized. However, the requirements of paragraph 1.3. shall still apply.

1.1.4.

The braking forces shall be calculated from the measured braking rate and the rolling resistance of the unbraked axle which is equal to 0.015 and 0.010 of the static axle load for a driven axle and a non-driven axle, respectively.

1.1.5.

The dynamic load on the axle shall be that given by the formulae in Annex 5

to this Regulation.

1.1.6.

The value of k shall be rounded to three decimal places.

1.1.7.

Then, the test will be repeated for the other axle(s) as defined in paragraphs 1.1.1. to 1.1.6. above.

1.2.4.

The value of  shall be rounded to two decimal places.

1.2.5.

In the case of a vehicle equipped with an anti-lock system of categories 1 or 2, the value of zAL will be based on the whole vehicle, with the anti-lock system in operation, and the adhesion utilized () is given by the same formula quoted in paragraph 1.2.1. of this appendix.

Annex 8




Special requirements to be applied to the safety aspects of complex electronic vehicle control systems

1.

General



This annex defines the special requirements for documentation, fault strategy and verification with respect to the safety aspects of Complex Electronic Vehicle Control Systems (definition 2.3. below) as far as this Regulation is concerned.



This annex may also be called, by special paragraphs in this Regulation, for safety related functions which are controlled by electronic system(s).



This annex does not specify the performance criteria for "The System" but covers the methodology applied to the design process and the information which shall be disclosed to the Technical Service, for type approval purposes.



This information shall show that "The System" respects, under normal and fault conditions, all the appropriate performance requirements specified elsewhere in this Regulation.

2.

Definitions



For the purposes of this annex,

2.1.

" Safety concep t" is a description of the measures designed into the system, for example within the electronic units, so as to address system integrity and thereby ensure safe operation even in the event of an electrical failure.



The possibility of a fall-back to partial operation or even to a back-up system for vital vehicle functions may be a part of the safety concept.

2.2.

" Electronic control system" means a combination of units, designed to co-operate in the production of the stated vehicle control function by electronic data processing.



Such systems, often controlled by software, are built from discrete functional components such as sensors, electronic control units and actuators and connected by transmission links. They may include mechanical, electro-pneumatic or electro-hydraulic elements.



" The System", referred to herein, is the one for which type approval is being sought.

2.3.

" Complex electronic vehicle control systems" are those electronic control systems which are subject to a hierarchy of control in which a controlled function may be over-ridden by a higher level electronic control system/function.



A function which is over-ridden becomes part of the complex system.

2.4.

" Higher-level control" systems/functions are those which employ additional processing and/or sensing provisions to modify vehicle behaviour by commanding variations in the normal function(s) of the vehicle control system.





65

UNECE R 13-H-01





This allows complex systems to automatically change their objectives with a priority which depends on the sensed circumstances.

2.5.

" Units" are the smallest divisions of system components which will be considered in this annex, since these combinations of components will be treated as single entities for purposes of identification, analysis or replacement.

2.6.

" Transmission links" are the means used for inter-connecting distributed units for the purpose of conveying signals, operating data or an energy supply.



This equipment is generally electrical but may, in some part, be mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or optical.

2.7.

" Range of control" refers to an output variable and defines the range over which the system is likely to exercise control.

2.8.

" Boundary of functional operation" defines the boundaries of the external physical limits within which the system is able to maintain control.

3.

Interconnections within "The System" shall be shown by a circuit diagram for the electrical transmission links, by an optical-fiber diagram for optical links, by a piping diagram for pneumatic or hydraulic transmission equipment and by a simplified diagrammatic layout for mechanical linkages.

3.3.4.

Signal flow and priorities



There shall be a clear correspondence between these transmission links and the signals carried between units.



Priorities of signals on multiplexed data paths shall be stated, wherever priority may be an issue affecting performance or safety as far as this Regulation is concerned.

3.3.5.

Identification of units



Each unit shall be clearly and unambiguously identifiable (e.g. by marking for hardware and marking or software output for software content) to provide corresponding hardware and documentation association.



Where functions are combined within a single Unit or indeed within a single computer, but shown in multiple blocks in the block diagram for clarity and ease of explanation, only a single hardware identification marking shall be used.



The manufacturer shall, by the use of this identification, affirm that the equipment supplied conforms to the corresponding document.

3.3.5.1.

The identification defines the hardware and software version and, where the latter changes such as to alter the function of the unit as far as this Regulation is concerned, this identification shall also be changed.

3.4.

Safety concept of the manufacturer

3.4.1.

The manufacturer shall provide a statement which affirms that the strategy chosen to achieve "The System" objectives will not, under non-fault conditions, prejudice the safe operation of systems which are subject to the prescriptions of this Regulation.

3.4.2.

In respect of software employed in "The System", the outline architecture shall be explained and the design methods and tools used shall be identified. The manufacturer shall be prepared, if required, to show some evidence of the means by which they determined the realisation of the system logic, during the design and development process.

3.4.3.

The Manufacturer shall provide the technical authorities with an explanation of the design provisions built into "The System" so as to generate safe operation under fault conditions. Possible design provisions for failure in "The System" are for example:

(a)

Fall-back to operation using a partial system;

(b)

Change-over to a separate back-up system;

(c)

Removal of the high level function.



In case of a failure, the driver shall be warned for example by warning signal or message display. When the system is not deactivated by the driver, e.g. by turning the Ignition (run) switch to "off", or by switching off that particular function if a special switch is provided for that purpose, the warning shall be present as long as the fault condition persists.

3.4.3.1.

If the chosen provision selects a partial performance mode of operation under certain fault conditions, then these conditions shall be stated and the resulting limits of effectiveness defined.

3.4.3.2.

If the chosen provision selects a second (back-up) means to realise the vehicle control system objective, the principles of the change-over mechanism, the logic and level of redundancy and any built in back-up checking features shall be explained and the resulting limits of back-up effectiveness defined.

3.4.3.3.

If the chosen provision selects the removal of the higher level function, all the corresponding output control signals associated with this function shall be inhibited, and in such a manner as to limit the transition disturbance.

3.4.4.

The documentation shall be supported, by an analysis which shows, in overall terms, how the system will behave on the occurrence of any one of those specified faults which will have a bearing on vehicle control performance or safety.



This may be based on a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) or any similar process appropriate to system safety considerations.



The chosen analytical approach(es) shall be established and maintained by the manufacturer and shall be made open for inspection by the Technical Service at the time of the type approval.

3.4.4.1.

This documentation shall itemise the parameters being monitored and shall set out, for each fault condition of the type defined in paragraph 3.4.4. above, the warning signal to be given to the driver and/or to service/technical inspection personnel.

4.

Verification and test

4.1.

The functional operation of "The System" , as laid out in the documents required in paragraph 3., shall be tested as follows:

4.1.1.

Verification of the function of "The System"



As the means of establishing the normal operational levels, verification of the performance of the vehicle system under non-fault conditions shall be conducted against the manufacturer's basic benchmark specification unless this is subject to a specified performance test as part of the approval procedure of this or another Regulation.

4.1.2.

Verification of the safety concept of paragraph 3.4. of this annex.



The reaction of "The System" shall, at the discretion of the Type Approval Authority, be checked under the influence of a failure in any individual unit by applying corresponding output signals to electrical units or mechanical elements in order to simulate the effects of internal faults within the unit.



The verification results shall correspond with the documented summary of the failure analysis, to a level of overall effect such that the safety concept and execution are confirmed as being adequate.
