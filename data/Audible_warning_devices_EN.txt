SPECIFICATIONS

6.1.

General specifications

6.1.1.

The audible warning device shall emit a continuous and uniform sound; its acoustic spectrum shall not vary substantially during its operation.

6.1.2.

The warning device shall have acoustic characteristics (spectral distribution of the acoustic energy, sound pressure level) and mechanical characteristics such that it passes, in the order indicated, the following tests.

6.2

Measurement of the sound level

6.2.1.

The warning device shall be tested in an anechoic chamber or at an open site. 2/ Background noise and wind noise must be at least 10 dB (A) below the sound to be measured. The microphone of the measuring instrument shall be placed in the direction where the subjective sound level is greatest;

-----------

1/

1 for the Federal Republic of Germany, 2 for France, 3 for Italy, 4 for the Netherlands, 5 for Sweden, 6 for Belgium, 7 for Hungary, 8 for Czechoslovakia, 9 for Spain, 10 for Yugoslavia, 11 for the United Kingdom, 12

for Austria, 13 for Luxembourg; subsequent figures shall be assigned to other countries in the

order in which they ratify or accede the Agreement concerning the Adoption of Uniform Conditions of Approval and Reciprocal Recognition of Approval for Motor Vehicle Equipment and Parts, and the figures thus assigned shall be communicated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the Contracting Parties to the Agreement.

2/

The site may take the form, for instance, of an open space of 50 metres radius, the central part of which must be practically horizontal over a radius of at least 20 metres, the surface being of concrete, asphalt or a similar material, which must not be covered with powdery snow, tall weeds, or loose soil or cinders. The measurements shall be made on a clear day. No-one other than the observer reading the instrument shall remain near the audible warning device or the microphone, since the presence of spectators may affect the readings of the instrument to a considerable extent, if they are near the audible warning device or the microphone. Any peak which appears to be unrelated to the general sound level shall be disregarded in the reading.

E/ECE/324

Rev.1/Add.27

E/ECE/TRANS/505 A

Regulation No. 28

page 4

the distance between the diaphragm of the microphone and the sound outlet of the device shall be 2 metres, the microphone and the warning device being placed at a height of 1. 20 m from the ground.

6.2.2.

The measurements shall be made on the basis of weighting curve A of the IEC (International Electro technical Commission) standards, using sonometers which conform to the type described in IEC publication No.

179, first edition, 1965.

6.2.3.

The device shall be supplied with current, as appropriate, at one of the test voltages of 6.5, 13 or 26 volts measured at the terminal of the electric power source and corresponding respectively to rated voltages of 6, 12 and 24 volts.

6.2.4.

If a rectified current source is used for the test, the alternating component of the voltage measured at its terminals, when the warning devices are in operation, shall not be more than 0.1 volt, peak to peak.

6.2.5.

The resistance of

the connecting leads, including terminals and contacts, shall be:

- 0.05 ohm for a rated voltage of 6 volts,

- 0.10 ohm for a rated voltage of 12 volts,

- 0.20 ohm for a rated voltage of 24 volts.

6.2.6.

The warning device shall be mounted rigidly, by means of the equipment indicated by the manufacturer, on a support whose mass is at least ten times that of the warning device under test and not less than 30 kg. In addition, arrangements must be made to ensure that reflexions on the sides of the support and its own vibrations have no appreciable effect on the measuring results.

6.2.7.

Under the conditions set forth above, the sound-pressure level weighted in accordance with curve A shall be at least 105 dB (A) and not greater than 118 dB (A).

6.2.8.

The time lapse between the moment when the device is actuated and the moment when the sound reaches the minimum value prescribed in paragraph 6.2.7. above shall not exceed 0.2 second measured at an ambient temperature of 20 + 5/C. This provision is applicable, inter alia, to pneumatic or electro-pneumatic warning devices.

6.3.

Endurance test

6.3.1.

The warning device shall be supplied with current at the rated voltage and with the connecting lead resistances specified in paragraphs 6.2.3.

to 6.2.5. above, and operated 50,000 times, each time for one second followed by an interval of four seconds. During the test, the device shall be ventilated by an air current having a speed of approximately 10 m/sec.

6.3.2.

If the test is made in an anechoic chamber, the chamber shall be large enough to ensure normal dispersal of the heat released by the warning device during the test.

6.3.3.

The ambient temperature in the testing room shall be between +15 and

+30/C.

6.3.4.

If, after the device has been operated 25,O00 times, the sound-level characteristics are no longer the same as before the test, the device may be adjusted. After being operated 50,000 times, and after further adjustment if necessary, the warning device must pass the test described in paragraph 6.2. above.

6.3.5.

For warning devices of the electro-pneumatic type, the device may be lubricated with the oil recommended by the manufacturer after every 10,000 times of operation.

6.4.

Sound spectrum

6.4.1.

The spectrum of the sound emitted by the device, measured at a distance of 2 m in accordance with the conditions specified in paragraph 6.2.1., must show, in the 1,800-3,550 Hz frequency band, a sound-pressure level higher than that of any frequency component above 3,550 Hz and in any case not less than 105 dB (A).

6.4.2.

The requirements indicated above must be met by a warning device which has been submitted to the test described in paragraph 6.3. above and which is supplied with current at voltages between 115 percent and 95

per cent of its rated voltage.

6.4.3.

The resistance of the connecting leads, including terminals and contacts, shall be as specified in paragraph 6.2.5.

6.4.4.

The warning device under test and the microphone shall be placed at the same height and the microphone shall be placed in the direction where the subjective sound level is greatest, forward of the warning device.

6.4.5.

The warning device shall be mounted rigidly, by means of the equipment indicated by the manufacturer, on a support whose mass is at most ten times that of the device under test and not less than 30 kg. In addition, arrangements must be made to ensure that reflexions on the sides of the support and its own vibrations have no appreciable effect on the measuring results.

6.4.6.

The test shall be made in an anechoic chamber.
