2.22.

" Asymmetric artificial network (AAN)” means network used to measure (or inject) asymmetric (common mode) voltages on unshielded symmetric signal (e.g. telecommunication) lines while rejecting the symmetric (differential mode) signal. This network is inserted in the communication/signal lines of the vehicle in charging mode to provide a specific load impedance and/or a decoupling (e.g. between communication/signal lines and power mains). AAN

is also used in this regulation for symmetric lines

2.23.

" Direct current charging artificial network (DC-charging-AN) means network inserted in the high voltage DC lead of vehicle in charging mode which provides, in a given frequency range, a specified load impedance and which may isolate the vehicle from the HV DC charging station in that frequency range.

5.

Asymmetric artificial network (AAN)

Currently, different technologies for signal/control port lines and/or wired network port lines are used for the communication between charging station and vehicle. Therefore, a distinction between some specific signal/control port lines and/or wired network port lines (for example, control pilot line, CAN lines) is necessary.

Measurement ports of AAN(s) shall be terminated with 50  loads.

AANs that are defined in 5.1., 5.2., 5.3. and 5.4. are used for unshielded signal/control port lines and/or wired network port lines.

If shielded signal/control port lines are used, then shielded AANs defined in CISPR 32:2015 Annex G, Figures G.10 and G.11 should be used.

5.1. Signal/Control port with symmetric lines

An asymmetric artificial network (AAN) to be connected between the vehicle and the charging station or any associated equipment (AE) used to simulate communication is defined in CISPR 16-1-2 Annex E clause E.2 (T network circuit) (see example in Figure 8).

The AAN has a common mode impedance of 150 . The impedance Zcat adjusts the symmetry of the cabling and attached periphery typically expressed as longitudinal conversion loss (LCL). The value of LCL should be predetermined by measurements or be defined by the manufacturer of the charging station/charging harness. The selected value for LCL and its origin shall be stated in the test report.

CAN communication is an example of symmetric lines used for vehicle DC charging mode.

If an original charging station can be used for the test, an AAN is not required for CAN

communication.

If the CAN communication is emulated and if the presence of the AAN prevents proper CAN communication, then no AAN should be used.

5.2. Wired network port with PLC on power lines

If an original charging station can be used for the test, an AAN and/or AMN/DC-charging-AN might not be required for PLC communication.

If the presence of the AMN/DC-charging-AN prevents proper PLC communication with the original charging station or if the PLC communication needs to be simulated by means of a piece of associated equipment (e.g. a PLC modem) instead of the original charging station, it is necessary to add an AAN between the AE (e.g. the PLC modem) and the AMN/DC-charging-AN output (vehicle side), as shown in Figure 9.

The circuit in Figure 9 provides a common mode termination by the AMN / DC-charging-AN HV-AN. In order to minimize emission from the PLC modem of the vehicle, an attenuator is located between the powerline and the PLC modem at the AE side in the circuit for emission tests. This attenuator consists of two resistors in combination with the input/output impedance of the PLC modem. The value of the resistors depends on the design impedance of the PLC modems and the allowed attenuation for the PLC system.

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

5.3. Signal/Control port with PLC (technology) on control pilot Some communication systems use the control pilot line (versus PE) with a superimposed (high frequency) communication. Typically the technology developed for powerline communication (PLC) is used for that purpose. On one hand the communication lines are operated unsymmetrically, on the other hand two different communication systems operate on the same line. Therefore, a special AAN must be used as defined in Figure 10.

It provides a common mode impedance of 150   20  (150 kHz to 30 MHz) on the control pilot line (assuming a design impedance of the modem of 100 ). Both types of communications (control pilot, PLC) are separated by the network.

Therefore, typically a communication simulation is used in combination with this network. The attenuator built by the resistors and the design impedance of the PLC

modem makes sure that the signal on the charging harness is dominated by the vehicle’s communication signals rather than the AE PLC modem.

The values of inductance and capacitance in the networks added for PLC on control pilot shown in Figure 10 shall not induce any malfunction of communication between vehicle and AE or charging station. It may therefore be necessary to adapt these values to ensure proper communication.

If PLC communication is emulated and if the presence of the AAN prevents proper PLC

communication then no AAN should be used.

5.4. Signal/Control port with control pilot

Some communication systems use the control pilot line (versus PE). On one hand the communication lines are operated unsymmetrically, on the other hand two different communication systems operate on the same line. Therefore, a special AAN must be used as defined in Figure 11.

It provides a common mode impedance of 150   20  (150 kHz to 30 MHz) on the control pilot line (between A and B/D).

Therefore, typically a communication simulation is used in combination with this network.

The values of inductance and capacitance in the networks on control pilot shown in Figure 11 shall not induce any malfunction of communication between vehicle and charging station. It may therefore be necessary to adapt these values to ensure proper communication.

If Control pilot communication is emulated and if the presence of the AAN prevents proper Control pilot communication then no AAN should be used.

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

Annex 4



Method of measurement of radiated broadband

electromagnetic emissions from vehicles

1.

General

1.1.

The test method described in this annex shall only be applied to vehicles. This method concerns both configurations of the vehicle:

(a)

Other than "REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid"; (b)

"REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid".

1.2.

Test method

This test is intended to measure the broadband emissions generated by electrical or electronic systems fitted to the vehicle (e.g. ignition system or electric motors).

If not otherwise stated in this annex the test shall be performed according to CISPR 12.

2.

Vehicle state during tests

2.1.

Vehicle in configuration other than "REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid".

2.1.1.

Engine

The engine shall be in operation according to CISPR 12.

For vehicle with an electric propulsion motor or hybrid propulsion system, if this is not appropriate (e.g. in case of busses, trucks, two- and three wheel vehicles), transmission shafts, belts or chains may be disconnected to achieve the same operation condition for the propulsion.

2.1.2.

Other vehicle systems

All equipment capable of generating broadband emissions which can be switched on permanently by the driver or passenger should be in operation in maximum load, e.g. wiper motors or fans. The horn and electric window motors are excluded because they are not used continuously.

2.2.

Vehicle in configuration "REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid".

The state of charge (SOC) of the traction battery shall be kept between 20 per cent and 80 per cent of the maximum SOC during the whole frequency range measurement (this may lead to splitting the measurement into different sub-bands with the need to discharge the vehicle's traction battery before starting the next sub-bands).

If the current consumption can be adjusted, then the current shall be set to at least 80 per cent of its nominal value for AC charging.

If the current consumption can be adjusted, then the current shall be set to at least 80 per cent of its nominal value for DC charging unless another value is agreed with the type approval authorities.



61

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

In case of multiple batteries the average state of charge must be considered.

The vehicle shall be immobilized, the engine(s) (ICE and / or electrical engine) shall be OFF and in charging mode. All other equipment which can be switched ON by the driver or passengers shall be OFF.

The test set-up for the connection of the vehicle in configuration "REESS

charging mode coupled to the power grid" is shown in Figures 3a to 3h (depending of AC or DC power charging mode, location of charging plug and charging with or without communication) of Appendix 1 to this annex.

2.3.

Vehicle in charging mode 1 or mode 2 (AC power charging without communication).

2.3.1.

Charging station / Power mains

The power mains socket can be placed anywhere in the test site with the following conditions:

-

The socket(s) shall be placed on the ground plane (ALSE) or floor (OTS);

-

The length of the harness between the power mains socket and the AMN(s) shall be kept as short as possible, but not necessarily aligned with the charging harness;

-

The harness shall be placed as close as possible to the ground plane (ALSE) or floor (OTS).

2.3.2.

Artificial network

Power mains shall be applied to the vehicle through 50 µH/50  artificial networks (AMN(s)) (see appendix 8 clause 4).

The AMN(s) shall be mounted directly on the ground plane (ALSE) or floor (OTS). The case of the AMN(s) shall be bonded to the ground plane (ALSE) or connected to the protective earth (OTS, e.g. an earth rod).

The measuring port of each AMN shall be terminated with a 50  load.

2.3.3.

Power charging harness

The power charging harness shall be placed in a straight line between the AMN(s) and the vehicle charging plug and shall be routed perpendicularly to the vehicle longitudinal axis (see Figure 3d and Figure 3c). The projected harness length from the side of the AMN(s) to the side of the vehicle shall be 0,8 (+0,2 / -0) m as shown in Figure 3d and Figure 3e.

For a longer harness the extraneous length shall be “Z-folded” in a less than 0,5 m width approximately around the middle of the AMN to vehicle distance.

If it is impractical to do so because of harness bulk or stiffness, or because the testing is being done at a user’s installation, the disposition of the excess harness shall be precisely noted in the test report.

The charging harness at the vehicle side shall hang vertically at a distance of 100 (+200 / -0) mm from the vehicle body.

The whole harness shall be placed on a non-conductive, low relative permittivity (dielectric-constant) material (r ≤ 1,4), at (100  25) mm above the ground plane (ALSE) or floor (OTS).

62

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

2.4.

Vehicle in charging mode 3 (AC power charging with communication) or mode 4 (DC power charging with communication).

2.4.1.

Charging station / Power mains

The charging station may be placed either in the test site or outside the test site.

If the local/private communication between the vehicle and the charging station can be simulated, the charging station may be replaced by a supply from the AC power mains network.

In both cases power mains and communication or signal lines socket(s) shall be placed in the test site with the following conditions:

-

The socket(s) shall be placed on the ground plane (ALSE) or floor

(OTS);

-

The length of the harness between the power mains / local/private communication socket and the AMN(s) / DC-charging-AN(s) / AAN(s)

shall be kept as short as possible, but not necessarily aligned with the charging harness;

-

The harness between the power mains / local/private communication socket and the AMN(s) / DC-charging-AN(s) / AAN(s) shall be placed

as close as possible of the ground plane (ALSE) or floor (OTS).

If the charging station is placed inside the test site, then the harness between the charging station and the power mains / local/private communication socket shall satisfy the following conditions:

-

The harness at charging station side shall hang vertically down to the ground plane (ALSE) or floor (OTS);

-

The extraneous length shall be placed as close as possible to the ground plane (ALSE) or floor (OTS) and “Z-folded” if necessary. If it is impractical to do so because of cable bulk or stiffness, or because the testing is being done at a user installation, the disposition of the excess cable shall be precisely noted in the test report.

The charging station should be placed outside of the 3 dB beamwidth of the receiving antenna. If this is not technically feasible, the charging station can be placed behind a panel of absorbers but not between the antenna and the vehicle.

2.4.2.

Artificial network

AC power mains shall be applied to the vehicle through 50 µH/50  AMN(s) (see Appendix 8, clause 4).

DC power mains shall be applied to the vehicle through 5 µH/50  High Voltage Artificial Networks (DC-charging-AN(s)) (see Appendix 8, clause 3).

The AMN(s) / DC-charging-AN(s) shall be mounted directly on the ground plane (ALSE) or floor (OTS). The cases of the AMN(s) / DC-charging-AN(s) shall be bonded to the ground plane (ALSE) or connected to the protective earth (OTS, e.g. an earth rod).

The measuring port of each AMN / DC-charging-AN shall be terminated with a 50  load.

2.4.3.

Asymmetric artificial network



63

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

Local/private communication lines connected to signal/control ports and lines connected to wired network ports shall be applied to the vehicle through AAN(s).

The various AAN(s) to be used are defined in Appendix 8, clause 5:

-

Clause 5.1 for signal/control port with symmetric lines;

-

Clause 5.2 for wired network port with PLC on power lines;

-

Clause 5.3 for signal/control port with PLC (technology) on control pilot; and

-

Clause 5.4 for signal/control port with control pilot.

The AAN(s) shall be mounted directly on the ground plane. The case of the AAN(s) shall be bonded to the ground plane (ALSE) or connected to the protective earth (OTS, e.g. an earth rod).

The measuring port of each AAN shall be terminated with a 50  load.

If a charging station is used, AAN(s) are not required for the signal/control ports and/or for the wired network ports. The local/private communication lines between the vehicle and the charging station shall be connected to the associated equipment on the charging station side to work as designed. If communication is emulated and if the presence of the AAN prevents proper communication then no AAN should be used

2.4.4.

Power charging / local/private communication harness

The power charging local/private communication harness shall be laid out in a straight line between the AMN(s) / DC-charging-AN(s) / AAN(s) and the vehicle charging socket and shall be routed perpendicularly to the vehicle’s longitudinal axis (see Figure 3f and Figure 3g). The projected harness length from the side of the AMN(s) to the side of the vehicle shall be 0,8 (+0,2 / -

0) m.

For a longer harness the extraneous length shall be “Z-folded” in less than 0,5 m width. If it is impractical to do so because of harness bulk or stiffness, or because the testing is being done at a user installation, the disposition of the excess harness shall be precisely noted in the test report.

The power charging local/private communication harness at vehicle side shall hang vertically at a distance of 100 (+200 / -0) mm from the vehicle body.

The whole harness shall be placed on a non-conductive, low relative permittivity (dielectric-constant) material (r ≤ 1,4), at (100  25) mm above the ground plane (ALSE) or floor (OTS).

3.

Measuring location

3.1.

As an alternative to the requirements of CISPR 12 for vehicles of category L, the test surface may be any location that fulfils the conditions shown in the Figure of the appendix to this annex. In this case the measuring equipment shall lie outside the part shown in Figure 1 of Appendix 1 to this annex.

3.2.

Absorber lined shielded enclosures (ALSE) and outdoor test site (OTS) may be used. An ALSE has the advantage of all all-weather testing, a controlled environment and improved repeatability because of the stable chamber electrical characteristics.

4.

Test requirements

64

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

4.1.

The limits apply throughout the frequency range 30 to 1,000 MHz for measurements performed in an absorber lined shielded enclosure (ALSE) or an outdoor test site (OTS).

4.2.

Measurements can be performed with either quasi-peak or peak detectors. The limits given in paragraphs 6.2. and 7.2. of this Regulation are for quasi-peak detectors. If peak detectors are used a correction factor of 20 dB as defined in CISPR 12 shall be applied.

4.3.

The measurements shall be performed with a spectrum analyser or a scanning receiver. The parameters to be used are defined in Table 1 and Table 2.

a For purely broadband disturbances, the maximum frequency step size may be increased up to a value not greater than the bandwidth value.

4.4.

Measurements

The Technical Service shall perform the test at the intervals specified in the CISPR 12 standard throughout the frequency range 30 to 1,000 MHz.

Alternatively, if the manufacturer provides measurement data for the whole frequency band from a test laboratory accredited to the applicable parts of ISO

17025 and recognized by the Type Approval Authority, the Technical Service may divide the frequency range in 14 frequency bands 30–34, 34–45, 45–60, 60–80, 80–100, 100–130, 130–170, 170–225, 225–300, 300–400, 400–525, 525–700, 700–850 and 850–1,000 MHz and perform tests at the 14 frequencies giving the highest emission levels within each band to confirm that the vehicle meets the requirements of this annex.

In the event that the limit is exceeded during the test, investigations shall be made to ensure that this is due to the vehicle and not to background radiation.

4.5.

Readings

The maximum of the readings relative to the limit (horizontal and vertical polarization and antenna location on the left and right-hand sides of the vehicle) in each of the 14 frequency bands shall be taken as the characteristic reading at the frequency at which the measurements were made.



65

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

4.6.

Antenna position

Measurements shall be made on the left and right sides of the vehicle.

The horizontal distance is from the reference point of the antenna to the nearest part of the vehicle body.

Multiple antenna positions may be required (both for 10 m and 3 m antenna distance) depending on the vehicle length. The same positions shall be used for both horizontal and vertical polarization measurements.

Annex 5



Method of measurement of radiated narrowband

electromagnetic emissions from vehicles

1.

General

1.1.

The test method described in this annex shall only be applied to vehicles. This method concerns only the configuration of the vehicle other than "REESS

charging mode coupled to the power grid".

1.2.

Test method

This test is intended to measure the narrowband electromagnetic emissions that may emanate from microprocessor-based systems or other narrowband source.

If not otherwise stated in this annex the test shall be performed according to CISPR 12 or CISPR 25.

1.3.

As an initial step the levels of emissions in the Frequency Modulation (FM) band (76 to 108 MHz) shall be measured at the vehicle broadcast radio antenna with an average detector. If the level specified in paragraph 6.3.2.4. of this Regulation is not exceeded, then the vehicle shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this annex in respect of that frequency band and the full test shall not be carried out.

1.4.

As an alternative for vehicles of category L the measurement location can be chosen according to Annex 4, paragraphs 3.1. and 3.2.

2.

Vehicle state during tests

2.1.

The ignition switch shall be switched on. The engine shall not be operating.

2.2.

The vehicle's electronic systems shall all be in normal operating mode with the vehicle stationary.

2.3.

All equipment which can be switched on permanently by the driver or passenger with internal oscillators > 9 kHz or repetitive signals should be in normal operation.

3.

Measuring location

3.1.

Absorber lined shielded enclosures (ALSE) and outdoor test site (OTS) may be used. An ALSE has the advantage of all all-weather testing, a controlled environment and improved repeatability because of the stable chamber electrical characteristics.

4

Test requirements

4.1.

The limits apply throughout the frequency range 30 to 1,000 MHz for measurements performed in an absorber lined shielded enclosure (ALSE) or an outdoor test site (OTS).

4.2.

Measurements shall be performed with an average detector.

4.3.

The measurements shall be performed with a spectrum analyser or a scanning receiver. The parameters to be used are defined in Table 1 and Table 2.

Measurements

The Technical Service shall perform the test at the intervals specified in the CISPR 12 standard throughout the frequency range 30 to 1,000 MHz.

Alternatively, if the manufacturer provides measurement data for the whole frequency band from a test laboratory accredited to the applicable parts of ISO

17025 and recognized by the Type Approval Authority, the Technical Service may divide the frequency range in 14 frequency bands 30–34, 34–45, 45–60, 60–80, 80–100, 100–130, 130–170, 170–225, 225–300, 300–400, 400–525, 525–700, 700–850 and 850–1,000 MHz and perform tests at the 14 frequencies giving the highest emission levels within each band to confirm that the vehicle meets the requirements of this Annex.

In the event that the limit is exceeded during the test, investigations shall be made to ensure that this is due to the vehicle and not to background radiation including broadband radiation from any ESA.

4.5.

Readings



The maximum of the readings relative to the limit (horizontal and vertical polarization and antenna location on the left and right-hand sides of the vehicle) in each of the 14 frequency bands shall be taken as the characteristic reading at the frequency at which the measurements were made.

4.6.

Antenna position

Measurements shall be made on the left and right sides of the vehicle.

The horizontal distance is from the reference point of the antenna to the nearest part of the vehicle body.

Multiple antenna positions may be required (both for 10 m and 3 m antenna distance) depending on the vehicle length. The same positions shall be used for both horizontal and vertical polarization measurements. The number of antenna positions and the position of the antenna with respect to the vehicle shall be documented in the test report.

- if the length of the vehicle is smaller than the 3 dB beamwidth of the antenna, only one antenna position is necessary. The antenna shall be aligned with the middle of the total vehicle (see Figure 1)



75

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

- If the length of the vehicle is greater than the 3 dB beamwidth of the antenna, multiple antenna positions are necessary in order to cover the total length of the vehicle (see Figure 2). The number of antenna positions shall allow to meet the following condition :

N  2  D  ta (

n  )  L (1)

With:

N: number of antenna positions.

D: measurement distance (3 m or 10 m).

2β: 3 dB antenna beamwidth angle in the plane parallel to ground (i.e. the E-plane beamwidth angle when the antenna is used in horizontal polarization, and the H-plane beamwidth angle when the antenna is used in vertical polarization).

L: total vehicle length.

Depending of the chosen values of N (number of antenna positions) different set-up shall be used:

if N=1 (only one antenna position is necessary) and the antenna shall be aligned with the middle of the total vehicle length (see Figure 1).

if N>1 (more than one antenna position is necessary) and multiple antenna positions are necessary in order to cover the total length of the vehicle (see Figure 2). The antenna positions shall be symmetric in regard to the vehicle perpendicular axis.

At a height of 1.0 ± 0.05 m above the plane on which the vehicle rests or 2.0 ± 0.05 m if the minimum height of the roof of any vehicle in the model range exceeds 3.0 m.

3.3.4.

Either at 1.0 ± 0.2 m behind the vertical centreline of the vehicle's front wheel (point C in Figure 1 of Appendix 1 to this annex) in the case of three-wheeled vehicles.

3.3.5.

If it is decided to radiate the rear of the vehicle, the reference point shall be established as in paragraphs 3.3.1. to 3.3.4. above. The vehicle shall then be installed facing away from the antenna and positioned as if it had been horizontally rotated 180° around its centre point, i.e. such that the distance from the antenna to the nearest part of the outer body of the vehicle remains the same. This is illustrated in Figure 3 of Appendix 1 to this annex.

4.

Test requirements

4.1.

Frequency range, dwell times, polarization.

The vehicle shall be exposed to electromagnetic radiation in the 20 to 2,000 MHz frequency ranges in vertical polarization.

The test signal modulation shall be:

(a)

AM (amplitude modulation), with 1 kHz modulation and 80 per cent modulation depth in the 20 to 800 MHz frequency range; and

(b)

PM (pulse modulation), Ton 577 µs, period 4,600 µs in the 800 to 2,000

MHz frequency range.

If not otherwise agreed between Technical Service and vehicle manufacturer.

Frequency step size and dwell time shall be chosen according to ISO 11451-1.

4.1.1.

The Technical Service shall perform the test at the intervals specified in ISO 11451-1 throughout the frequency range 20 to 2,000 MHz.

Alternatively, if the manufacturer provides measurement to data for the whole frequency band from a test laboratory accredited to the applicable parts of ISO

17025 and recognized by the Type Approval Authority, the Technical Service may choose a reduced number of spot frequencies in the range, e.g. 27, 45, 65, 90, 120, 150, 190, 230, 280, 380, 450, 600, 750, 900, 1,300 and 1,800 MHz to confirm that the vehicle meets the requirements of this annex.

If a vehicle fails the test defined in this annex, it shall be verified as having failed under the relevant test conditions and not as a result of the generation of uncontrolled fields.

5.

Generation of required field strength

5.1.

Test methodology

5.1.1.

The substitution method according to ISO 11451-1, shall be used to establish the test field conditions.

5.1.2.

Calibration



For TLS one field probe at the vehicle reference point shall be used.

84

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6



For antennas four field probes at the vehicle reference line shall be used.

5.1.3.

Test phase



The vehicle shall be positioned with the centre line of the vehicle on the vehicle reference point or line. The vehicle shall normally face a fixed antenna.

However, where electronic control units with immunity related functions and the associated wiring harness are predominantly in the rear half of the vehicle, the test should normally be carried out with the vehicle facing away from the antenna and positioned as if it had been horizontally rotated 180° around its centre point, i.e. such that the distance from the antenna to the nearest part of the outer body of the vehicle remains the same. In the case of long vehicles (i.e. excluding vehicles of categories L, M1 and N1), which have electronic control units with immunity related functions and associated wiring harness predominantly towards the middle of the vehicle, a reference point may be established based on either the right side surface or the left side surface of the vehicle. This reference point shall be at the midpoint of the vehicle's length or at one point along the side of the vehicle chosen by the manufacturer in conjunction with the Type Approval Authority after considering the distribution of electronic systems and the layout of any wiring harness.



Such testing may only take place if the physical construction of the chamber permits. The antenna location shall be noted in the test report.

Annex 7



Method of measurement of radiated broadband

electromagnetic emissions from electrical/electronic

sub-assemblies (ESAs)

1.

General

1.1.

The test method described in this annex may be applied to ESAs, which may be subsequently fitted to vehicles, which comply with Annex 4.

This method concerns both kinds of ESA:

(a)

Other ESAs than involved in "REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid".

(b)

ESAs involved in "REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid".

1.2.

Test method

This test is intended to measure broadband electromagnetic emissions from ESAs (e.g. ignition systems, electric motor, onboard battery charging unit, etc.).

If not otherwise stated in this annex the test shall be performed according CISPR 25.

2.

ESA state during tests

2.1.

The ESA under test shall be in normal operation mode, preferably in maximum load.

ESAs involved in "REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid" shall be in charging mode.

The state of charge (SOC) of the traction battery shall be kept between 20 per cent and 80 per cent of the maximum SOC during the whole frequency range measurement (this may lead to split the measurement in different sub-bands with the need to discharge the vehicle's traction battery before starting the next sub-bands).

If the test is not performed with a REESS the ESA should be tested at rated current.

If the current consumption can be adjusted, then the current shall be set to at least 80 per cent of its nominal value for AC charging.

If the current consumption can be adjusted, then the current shall be set to at least 80 per cent of its nominal value for DC charging unless another value is agreed with the type approval authorities.

3.

Test arrangements

3.1.

For ESA other than involved in "REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid" the test shall be performed according to the ALSE method described in paragraph 6.4. of CISPR 25.

92

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

3.2.

For ESAs in configuration "REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid"

the test arrangement shall be according to Figure 2 of the appendix to this annex.

3.2.1.

The shielding configuration shall be according to the vehicle series configuration. Generally all shielded High Voltage (HV) parts shall be properly connected with low impedance to ground (e.g. AN, cables, connectors etc.). ESAs and loads shall be connected to ground. The external HV power supply shall be connected via feed-through-filtering.

3.2.2.

The ESA power supply lead shall be connected to the power supply through an HV-AN (for ESA with DC HV supply) and/or AMN (for ESA with AC

supply).

DC HV supply shall be applied to the ESA via a 5 μH/50 Ω HV-AN

(see Appendix 8 clause 2).

AC supply shall be applied to the ESA via a 50 μH/50 Ω AMN (see Appendix 8 clause 4).

3.2.3.

Unless otherwise specified the length of the Low Voltage (LV) harness and the HV harness parallel to the front edge of the ground plane shall be 1,500 mm (±75 mm). The total length of the test harness including the connector shall be 1,700 mm (+300/-0 mm). The distance between the LV harness and the HV

harness shall be 100 mm (+100/-0 mm).

3.2.4.

All of the harnesses shall be placed on a non-conductive, low relative permittivity material (εr ≤ 1.4), at 50 mm (±5 mm) above the ground plane.

3.2.5.

Shielded supply lines for HV+ and HV- line and three phase lines may be coaxial cables or in a common shield depending on the used plug system. The original HV-harness from the vehicle may be used optionally.

3.2.6.

Unless otherwise specified, the ESA case shall be connected to the ground plane either directly or via defined impedance.

3.2.7.

For onboard chargers, the AC/DC power lines shall be placed the furthest from the antenna (behind LV and HV harness). The distance between the AC/DC

power lines and the closest harness (LV or HV) shall be 100 mm (+100/-0

mm).

3.3.

Alternative measuring location

As an alternative to an absorber lined shielded enclosure (ALSE) an open area test site (OATS), which complies with the requirements of CISPR

16-1-4 may be used (see Figure 1 of the appendix to this annex).

3.4.

Ambient

To ensure that there is no extraneous noise or signal of a magnitude sufficient to affect materially the measurement, measurements shall be taken before or after the main test. In this measurement, the extraneous noise or signal shall be at least 6 dB below the limits of interference given in paragraph 6.5.2.1. of this Regulation, except for intentional narrowband ambient transmissions.

Test requirements

4.1.

The limits apply throughout the frequency range 30 to 1,000 MHz for measurements performed in an absorber lined shielded enclosure (ALSE) or open area test site (OATS).

4.2.

Measurements can be performed with either quasi-peak or peak detectors. The limits given in paragraphs 6.5. and 7.10. of this Regulation are for quasi-peak detectors. If peak detectors are used a correction factor of 20 dB as defined in CISPR 12 shall be applied.

4.3.

The measurements shall be performed with a spectrum analyser or a scanning receiver. The parameters to be used are defined in Table 1 and Table 2.

a For purely broadband disturbances, the maximum frequency step size may be increased up to a value not greater than the bandwidth value.

Note: For emissions generated by brush commutator motors without an electronic control unit, the maximum step size may be increased up to five times the bandwidth.

4.4.

Measurements

Unless otherwise specified the configuration with the LV harness closer to the antenna shall be tested.

The phase centre of the antenna shall be in line with the centre of the longitudinal part of the wiring harnesses for frequencies up to 1,000 MHz.

The Technical Service shall perform the test at the intervals specified in the CISPR 12 standard throughout the frequency range 30 to 1,000 MHz.

Alternatively, if the manufacturer provides measurement to data for the whole frequency band from a test laboratory accredited to the applicable parts of ISO

17025 and recognized by the Type Approval Authority, the Technical Service may divide the frequency range in 14 frequency bands 30–34, 34–45, 45–60, 60–80, 80–100, 100–130, 130–170, 170–225, 225–300, 300–400, 400–525, 525–700, 700–850 and 850– 1,000 MHz and perform tests at the 14

94

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

frequencies giving the highest emission levels within each band to confirm that the ESA meets the requirements of this annex.

In the event that the limit is exceeded during the test, investigations shall be made to ensure that this is due to the ESA and not to background radiation.

4.5.

Readings

The maximum of the readings relative to the limit (horizontal/vertical polarization) in each of the 14 frequency bands shall be taken as the characteristic reading at the frequency at which the measurements were made.

2.2.

The ESA under test shall be switched on and shall be stimulated to be in normal operation condition. It shall be arranged as defined in this annex unless individual test methods dictate otherwise.

ESAs involved in "REESS charging mode coupled to the power grid" shall be in charging mode.

The state of charge (SOC) of the traction battery shall be kept between 20 per cent and 80 per cent of the maximum SOC during the whole frequency range measurement (this may lead to split the measurement in different sub-bands with the need to discharge the vehicle's traction battery before starting the next sub-bands).

100

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

If the test is not performed with a REESS the ESA should be tested at rated current. If the current consumption can be adjusted, then the current shall be set to at least 20 per cent of its nominal value.

2.3.

Any extraneous equipment required to operate the ESA under test shall not be in place during the calibration phase. No extraneous equipment shall be closer than 1 m from the reference point during calibration.

2.4.

To ensure reproducible measurement results are obtained when tests and measurements are repeated, the test signal generating equipment and its layout shall be to the same specification as that used during each appropriate calibration phase.

2.5.

If the ESA under test consists of more than one unit, the interconnecting cables should ideally be the wiring harnesses as intended for use in the vehicle. If these are not available, the length between the electronic control unit and the AN shall be as defined in the standard. All cables in the wiring harness should be terminated as realistically as possible and preferably with real loads and actuators.

3.

Stripline testing



103

E/ECE/324/Add.9/Rev.6

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Add.9/Rev.6

4.4.1.

Test method

This test method consists of subjecting the wiring harness connecting the components in an ESA to specified field strengths.

4.4.2.

Test methodology

The test shall be performed according to ISO 11452-5.

4.5.

800 mm stripling testing

4.5.1.

Test method

The stripline consists of two parallel metallic plates separated by 800 mm.

Equipment under test is positioned centrally between the plates and subjected to an electromagnetic field (see Appendix 1 to this annex).

This method can test complete electronic systems including sensors and actuators as well as the controller and wiring loom. It is suitable for apparatus whose largest dimension is less than one-third of the plate separation.

4.5.2.

Test methodology

4.5.2.1.

Positioning of stripline

The stripline shall be housed in a screened room (to prevent external emissions) and positioned 2 m away from walls and any metallic enclosure to prevent electromagnetic reflections. RF absorber material may be used to damp these reflections. The stripline shall be placed on non-conducting supports at least 0.4 m above the floor.

4.5.2.2.

Calibration of the stripline

A field-measuring probe shall be positioned within the central one-third of the longitudinal, vertical and transverse dimensions of the space between the parallel plates with the system under test absent.

The associated measuring equipment shall be sited outside the screen room. At each desired test frequency, a level of power shall be fed into the stripline to produce the required field strength at the antenna. This level of forward power, or another parameter directly related to the forward power required to define the field, shall be used for type approval tests unless changes occur in the facilities or equipment, which necessitate this procedure being repeated.

4.5.2.3.

Installation of the ESA under test

The main control unit shall be positioned within the central one third of the longitudinal, vertical and transverse dimensions of the space between the parallel plates. It shall be supported on a stand made from non-conducting material.

4.5.2.4.

Main wiring loom and sensor/actuator cables

The main wiring loom and any sensor/actuator cables shall rise vertically from the control unit to the top ground plate (this helps to maximize coupling with the electromagnetic field). Then they shall follow the underside of the plate to one of its free edges where they shall loop over and follow the top of the ground plate as far as the connections to the stripline feed. The cables shall then be routed to the associated equipment, which shall be sited in an area outside the 104
