Annex 3




Latch test for load tests one, two, and three, force application 1.

Purpose



These tests are intended to establish minimum performance requirements and test procedures for evaluating and testing vehicle door latch systems for their ability to resist force loads in directions perpendicular to the latch face and parallel to the latch face in the fork-bolt opening direction. For doors which open in a vertical direction, the tests are intended to also establish minimum performance requirements and a test procedure for evaluating the primary latch system in a direction orthogonal to the first two directions. Primary door latch systems must demonstrate the ability to resist applicable force loads in both the fully and secondary latched positions; auxiliary door latch systems, and other door latch systems with only a fully-latched position, must demonstrate the ability to resist force loads in directions perpendicular to the latch face and parallel to the latch face in the fork-bolt opening direction at the levels specified for the fully latched position.

Inertial test procedures


1.

Purpose



To determine the ability of the vehicle latch system to resist inertial loading by means of a mathematical analysis of the component parts in their true car relationship or by evaluation using a dynamic test.

2.

Test procedures

2.1.

Option 1, Calculation.

2.1.1.

The procedure described in this annex provides a means for analytically determining the ability of a door latch system to withstand inertial loading.

Spring forces are the average of the minimum spring output in the installed position and the minimum spring output in the release position. Friction effects and work to be done are not considered in the calculations.

Gravitational pull on components may also be omitted if it tends to restrict unlatching. These omissions from the calculations are permissible because they provide additional factors of safety.

2.1.2.

Calculation Consideration - Each component or subassembly can be calculated for its minimum inertial load resistance in a particular direction.

Their combined resistance to the unlatching operation must assure that the door latch system (when properly assembled in the vehicle door) will remain latched when subjected to an inertial load of 30 g in any direction. Figure 4-1

is an example of the components and combinations of components to be considered.

2.2.

Option 2, Full vehicle dynamic test

The test setup is shown in Figure 6-1. The force application system shall include the following:

2.2.1.

Two force application plates.

2.2.2.

Two force application devices capable of applying the outward transverse load requirements for a minimum displacement of 300 mm.

2.2.3.

Two load cells of sufficient capacity to measure the applied loads.

2.2.4.

Two linear displacement measurement devices required for measuring force application device displacement during the test.

3.

Test setup

3.1.

Remove all interior trim and decorative components from the sliding door assembly.

3.2.

Remove seats and any interior components that may interfere with the mounting and operation of the test equipment and all pillar trim and any non-structural components that overlap the door and cause improper placement of the force application plates.

3.3.

Mount the force application devices and associated support structure to the floor of the test vehicle. Each force application device and associated support structure is rigidly fixed on a horizontal surface on the vehicle floor, while applying the loads.

3.4.

Determine the forward and aft edge of the sliding door, or its adjoining vehicle structure, that contains a latch/striker.

3.5.

Close the sliding door, ensuring that all door retention components are fully engaged.

3.6.

For any tested door edge that contains one latch/striker, the following setup procedures are used:

3.6.2.

Place the force application device and force application plate against the door so that the applied force is horizontal and normal to the vehicleâ€™s longitudinal centreline, and vertically centred on the door-mounted portion of the latch/striker.

3.6.3.

The force application plate is positioned such that the long edge of the plate is as close to, and parallel to, the interior edge of the door as possible, but not such that the forward edge of the plate is more than 12.5 mm from the interior edge.

3.7.

For any tested door edge that contains more than one latch/striker, the following setup procedures are used:

3.7.1.

The force application plate is 300 mm in length, and 50 mm in width, and at least 15 mm in thickness. The plate edges are rounded to a radius of 6 mm Â± 1 mm.

3.7.2.

Place the force application device and force application plate against the door so that the applied force is horizontal and normal to the vehicleâ€™s longitudinal centreline, and vertically centred on a point mid-way between the outermost edges of the latch/striker assemblies.

3.7.3.

The force application plate is positioned such that the long edge of the plate is as close to, and parallel to, the interior edge of the door as possible, but not such that the forward edge of the plate is more than 12.5 mm from the interior edge.

3.8.

For any tested door edge that does not contain at least one latch/striker, the following setup procedures are used:

3.8.1.

The force application plate is 300 mm in length, 50 mm in width, and at least 15 mm in thickness.

3.8.2.

Place the force application device and force application plate against the door so that the applied force is horizontal and normal to the vehicleâ€™s longitudinal centreline, and vertically centred on a point mid-way along the length of the door edge ensuring that the loading device avoids contact with the window glazing.

3.8.3.

The force application plate is positioned as close to the edge of the door as possible. It is not necessary for the force application plate to be vertical.

3.9.

The door is unlocked. No extra fixtures or components may be welded or affixed to the sliding side door or any of its components.

3.10.

Attach any equipment used for measuring door separation that will be used to determine separation levels during the test procedure.

3.11.

Place the load application structure so that the force application plates are in contact with the interior of the sliding door.

Test procedure

4.1.

Move each force application device at a rate up to 2,000 N per minute, as specified by the manufacturer, until a force of 9,000 N is achieved on each 35

Annex 6




force application device or until either force application device reaches a total displacement of 300 mm.

4.2.

If one of the force application devices reaches the target force of 9,000 N

prior to the other, maintain the 9,000 N force with that force application device until the second force application device reaches the 9,000 N force.

4.3.

Once both force application devices have achieved 9,000 N each, stop forward movement of the force application devices and hold under the resulting load for a minimum of 10 seconds.

4.4.

Maintain the force application device position of paragraph 4.3., and within 60 seconds, measure the separation between the exterior edge of the doorframe and the interior of the door along the perimeter of the door.
