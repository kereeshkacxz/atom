In the case of a safety-belt with tension-reducing device, it shall be subjected to a durability test with such a device in operation mode according to paragraph 6.2.5.3.5 before a dynamic test. The dynamic test shall then be conducted with the tension-reducing device in operation mode.

6.4.1.3.

During this test, the following requirements shall be met:

6.4.1.3.1.

No part of the belt assembly or a restraint system affecting the restraint of the occupant shall break and no buckles or locking system or displacement system shall release or unlock; and

6.4.1.3.2.

The forward displacement of the manikin shall be between 80 and 200 mm at pelvic level in the case of lap belts. In the case of other types of belts, the forward displacement shall be between 80 and 200 mm at pelvic level and between 100 and 300 mm at chest level. In the case of a harness belt, the minimum displacements specified above may be reduced by half. These displacements are the displacements in relation to the measurement points shown in Annex 7, Figure 6 to this Regulation.

6.4.1.3.3.

In the case of a safety-belt intended to be used in an outboard front seating position protected by an airbag in front of it, the displacement of the chest reference point may exceed that specified in paragraph 6.4.1.3.2. above if its speed at this value does not exceed 24 km/h.

6.4.1.3.4.

In case of a seating position, other than the outboard front seating position, which is protected with an airbag in front of it, the displacement of the chest reference point may exceed that specified in paragraph 6.4.1.3.2. if its speed at this value does not exceed 24 km/h in tests performed with the airbag in a vehicle related environment, reflecting the vehicle coordinates of the airbag mounting and attachment points.

6.4.1.4.

In the case of a restraint system:

6.4.1.4.1.

The movement of the chest reference point may exceed that specified in paragraph 6.4.1.3.2. above if it can be shown either by calculation or a further test that no part of the torso or the head of the manikin used in the dynamic test 20

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.15/Rev.10

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.15/Rev.10



would have come into contact with any forward rigid part of the vehicle other than:

6.4.1.4.1.1.

In the case of the driver, contact of the chest with the steering assembly would be allowed, if the latter meets the requirements of UN Regulation No. 12 and provided contact does not occur at a speed higher than 24 km/h. For this assessment the seat shall be considered to be in the positions specified in paragraph 7.7.1.5. below.

6.4.1.4.1.2.

In the case of any other occupant, contact of the head or of the chest with any rigid part of the vehicle in front of the manikin is not allowed. Additionally contact of the manikins head with its knees is not allowed.



For this assessment the seat of the tested manikin and, if applicable, the seat in front of the manikin shall be considered to be in the positions specified in paragraph 7.7.1.6. below. With the exception of the deployed structure of an airbag assembly defined in para. 2.8., non-rigid material of < 50 Shore A hardness may be removed in order to demonstrate that covered or padded rigid parts are not contacted by the head or the chest of the manikin during the test.

6.4.1.4.2.

In vehicles where such devices are used, the displacement and locking systems enabling the occupants of all seats to leave the vehicle shall still be operable by hand after the dynamic test.

6.4.1.5.

By way of derogation, in case of a restraint system, the displacements may be greater than those specified in paragraph 6.4.1.3.2. in the case where the upper anchorage fitted to the seat profits from the derogation provided in paragraph 7.4. of UN Regulation No. 14.

6.4.2.

Strength after abrasion conditioning

7.5.6.

When testing a manually adjusting device, the strap shall be drawn steadily through the adjusting device, having regard for the normal conditions of use, at a rate of approximately 100 mm/s and the maximum force measured to the nearest 0.1 daN after the first 25 mm of strap movement. The test shall be carried out in both directions of strap travel through the device, the strap being cycled 10 times prior to the measurement.

7.6.

Additional tests for safety-belts with retractors

7.6.1.

Durability of retractor mechanism

7.6.1.1.

The strap shall be withdrawn and allowed to retract for the required number of cycles at a rate of not more than 30 cycles per minute. In the case of emergency locking retractors, a snatch to lock the retractor shall be introduced at each fifth cycle.



The snatches shall occur in equal numbers at each of five different extractions, namely, 90, 80, 75, 70 and 65 per cent of the total length of the strap remaining wound on the retractor. However, where more than 900 mm is provided the above percentages shall be related to the final 900 mm of strap which can be withdrawn from the retractor.

7.6.1.2.

7.6.2.1.1.

In the case of a retractor actuated by strap movement, the extraction shall be in the direction in which it normally occurs when the retractor is installed in a vehicle.

7.6.2.1.2.

When retractors are being tested for sensitivity to vehicle deceleration they shall be tested at the above extraction along two perpendicular axes, which are horizontal if the retractor is installed in a vehicle as specified by the safety-belt manufacturer. When this position is not specified, the testing authority shall consult the safety-belt manufacturer. One of these axes shall be in the direction chosen by the Technical Service conducting the approval test to give the most adverse conditions with respect to actuation of the locking mechanism.

7.6.2.2.

A suitable apparatus for the tests specified in paragraph 7.6.2.1. above is described in Annex 4 to this Regulation. The design of any such test apparatus shall ensure that the required acceleration is given before the webbing is withdrawn out of the retractor by more than 5 mm and that the withdrawal takes place at an average rate of increase of acceleration of at least 55 g/s7 and not more than 150 g/s7 in testing sensitivity for strap movement and of at least 25 g/s7 and not more than 150 g/s7 in testing sensitivity for vehicle deceleration.7

7.6.2.3.

To check conformity with the requirements of paragraphs 6.2.5.3.1.3. and 6.2.5.3.1.4., the retractor shall be mounted on a horizontal table and the table tilted with a speed not exceeding 2° per second until locking has occurred. The test shall be repeated with tilting in other directions to ensure that the requirements are fulfilled.

P

26

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.15/Rev.10

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.15/Rev.10



from the retractor and kept extracted, except that it shall be subjected to 10 complete cycles of retraction and withdrawal within one or two minutes after each agitation of the dust. For a period of five hours, the dust shall be agitated every 20 minutes for five seconds by compressed air free of oil and moisture at a gauge pressure of 5.5 · 105 ± 0.5 · 105 Pa entering through an orifice, 1.5  0.1 mm in diameter.

7.6.3.2.

The dust used in the test described in paragraph 7.6.3.1. above shall consist of about 1 kg of dry quartz. The particle size distribution is as follows: (a)

Passing 150 μm aperture, 104 μm wire diameter: 99 to 100 per cent; (b)

Passing 105 μm aperture, 64 μm wire diameter: 76 to 86 per cent; (c)

Passing 75 μm aperture, 52 μm wire diameter: 60 to 70 per cent.

7.6.4.

Retracting forces

7.6.4.1.

The retracting force shall be measured with the safety-belt assembly fitted to a dummy as for the dynamic test prescribed in paragraph 7.7. below. The strap tension shall be measured at the point of contact with (but just clear of) the dummy while the strap is being retracted at the approximate rate of 0.6 m/min.

In the case of a safety-belt with tension-reducing device, the retracting force and strap tension shall be measured with the tension-reducing device in both operation mode and non-operation mode.

7.6.4.2.

Before the dynamic test described in paragraph 7.7. below the seated dummy, which is clothed with a cotton shirt, shall be tilted frontward until 350 mm of the strap is withdrawn from retractor, and then released to the initial position.

7.7.

Dynamic test of belt assembly or of the restraint system

7.7.1.

The belt assembly shall be mounted on a trolley equipped with the seat and the general anchorages as defined in Annex 6, Figure 1, to this Regulation.

However, if the belt assembly is intended for a specific vehicle or for specific types of vehicle, the distances between the manikin and the anchorages shall be determined by the Technical Service conducting the tests, either in conformity with the instructions for fitting supplied with the belt or in conformity with the data supplied by the manufacturer of the vehicle. If the belt is equipped with a belt adjustment device for height such as defined in paragraph 2.14.6. above, the position of the device and the means of securing it shall be the same as those of the vehicle design.



In that case, when the dynamic test has been carried out for a type of vehicle it need not be repeated for other types of vehicle where each anchorage point is less than 50 mm distant from the corresponding anchorage point of the tested belt. Alternatively, manufacturers may determine hypothetical anchorage positions for testing in order to enclose the maximum number of real anchorage points.

7.7.1.1.

In the case of a safety-belt or restraint system forming part of an assembly for which type approval is requested as a restraint system, the safety-belt shall be mounted either as defined in paragraph 7.7.1. or on the part of the vehicle structure to which the restraint system is normally fitted and this part shall be rigidly attached to the test trolley in the way prescribed in paragraphs 7.7.1.2.

to 7.7.1.6. below.



In the case of a safety-belt or restraint system with pre-loading devices relying on component parts other than those incorporated in the belt assembly itself, the belt assembly shall be mounted in conjunction with the necessary additional vehicle parts on the test trolley in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 7.7.1.2. to 7.7.1.6. below.



Alternatively, in the case where those devices cannot be tested on the test trolley, the manufacturer may demonstrate by a conventional frontal impact 27

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.15/Rev.10

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.15/Rev.10



test at 50 km/h in conformity with the procedure ISO 3560 (1975) that the device complies with the requirements of this Regulation.

7.7.1.2.

The method used to secure the vehicle during the test shall not be such as to strengthen the anchorages of the seats or safety-belts or to lessen the normal deformation of the structure. No forward part of the vehicle shall be present which by limiting the forward movement of the manikin excepting the foot, would reduce the load imposed on the restraint system during the test. The parts of the structure eliminated can be replaced by parts of equivalent strength provided they do not hinder the forward movement of the manikin.

7.7.1.3.

A securing device shall be regarded as satisfactory if it produces no effect on an area extending over the whole width of the structure and if the vehicle or the structure is blocked or fixed in front at a distance of not less than 500 mm from the anchorage of the restraint system. At the rear the structure shall be secured at a sufficient distance rearwards of the anchorages to ensure that the requirements of paragraph 7.7.1.2. above are fulfilled.

7.7.1.4.

The seats of the vehicle shall be fitted and shall be placed in the position for driving use chosen by the Technical Service conducting approval tests to give the most adverse conditions with respect to strength, compatible with installing the manikin in the vehicle. The positions of the seats shall be stated in the report. The seat back, if adjustable for inclination, shall be locked as specified by the manufacturer or, in the absence of any specification, to an actual seat back angle as near as possible to 25° in the case of vehicles of categories M1

and N1 as near as possible to 15° in the case of vehicles of all other categories.

7.7.1.5.

For the assessment of the requirements in paragraphs 6.4.1.4.1. and 6.4.1.4.1.1.

the seat shall be positioned in its most forward driving position appropriate to the dimensions of the manikin.

7.7.1.6.

For the assessment of the requirements in paragraphs 6.4.1.4.1. and 6.4.1.4.1.2.

the seat adjustment shall be:

7.7.1.6.1.

For front passenger seats: the occupant in the front shall be in its most forward travelling position according to the dimensions of the manikin. The positions of the seats shall be stated in the report.

7.7.1.6.2.

For rear seats: For any testing position of rear seated occupants, the position of the tested seating position, shall be considered as positioned to the seats R-Point.

If the seat back is adjustable, the seat back angle should be adjusted using the 3-D H Point machine with its torso angle as close as possible to 10°.

The seating position in front of the tested seating position shall be adjusted to the middle position of travel and height or in the nearest locking position thereto. If the seat back of this seat is adjustable, the seat back angle should be adjusted using the 3-D H Point machine with its torso angle as close as possible to 10°.

This may be proven by a contour on CAD or drawing of the in-vehicle situation.

7.7.1.7.

Alternatively to paragraphs 7.7.1.5. and 7.7.1.6., in the case where those devices cannot be tested on the test trolley, the manufacturer may demonstrate by a conventional frontal impact test at 50 km/h in conformity with the procedure ISO 3560:2013 that the device complies with the requirements of this Regulation.

7.7.1.8.

All the seats of any group of seats shall be tested simultaneously.

7.7.1.9.

The dynamic tests of the harness belt system shall be carried out without the crotch strap (assembly), if there is any.

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.15/Rev.10



of engagement of the two parts of the buckle entails no risk of reducing the reliability of locking.

7.7.3.

The free ends of the straps shall extend sufficiently far beyond the adjusting devices to allow for slip.

7.7.4.

Deceleration or acceleration devices



The applicant shall choose to use one of the two following devices: 7.7.4.1.

Deceleration test device



The trolley shall be so propelled that at the moment of impact its free running speed is 50 km/h ± 1 km/h and the manikin remains stable. The stopping distance of the trolley shall be 40 cm ± 5 cm. The trolley shall remain horizontal throughout deceleration. The deceleration of the trolley shall be achieved by using the apparatus described in Annex 6 to this Regulation or any other device giving equivalent results. This apparatus shall comply with the performance hereafter specified:



The deceleration curve of the trolley, weighted with inert mass to produce a total mass of 455 kg ± 20 kg for safety-belts tests and 910 kg ± 40 kg for restraining systems tests where the nominal mass of the trolley and vehicle structure is 800 kg, shall remain within the hatched area of the graph in Annex 8. If necessary, the nominal mass of the trolley and attached vehicle structure can be increased by increments of 200 kg, in which case, an additional inert mass of 28 kg per increment shall be added. In no case shall the total mass of the trolley and vehicle structure and inert masses differ from the nominal value for calibration tests by more than ±40 kg. During calibration of the stopping device, the speed of the trolley shall be 50 km/h ± 1 km/h and the stopping distance shall be of 40 cm ± 2 cm.

7.7.4.2.

Acceleration test device



The trolley shall be so propelled that its total velocity change V is

+ 2

51 km/h

km/h. The trolley shall remain horizontal during the acceleration.

− 0

The acceleration of the trolley shall be achieved by using the apparatus complying with the performance hereafter specified:



The acceleration curve of the trolley, weighted with inert mass, shall remain within the hatched area of the graph in Annex 8, and stay above the segment defined by the coordinates 10 g, 5 ms and 20 g, 10 ms. The start of the impact (T0) is defined, according to ISO 17 373 (2005) for a level of acceleration of 0.5 g. In no case shall the total mass of the trolley and vehicle structure and inert masses differ from the nominal value for calibration tests by more than ±40 kg. During calibration of the acceleration test device, trolley’s total

+ 2

velocity change V shall be 51 km/h

km/h.

− 0



Despite the fulfilment of the above requirements, the Technical Service shall use a mass of trolley (equipped with its seats), as specified in paragraph 1. of Annex 6, greater than 380 kg.

7.7.5.

The trolley speed immediately before impact (only for deceleration trolleys, needed for stopping distance calculation), the trolley acceleration or deceleration, the forward displacement of the manikin and the speed of the chest at a 300 mm displacement of the chest shall be measured.



The velocity change will be calculated by integration of the recorded trolley acceleration or deceleration.

+1



The distance to achieve the first 50 km/h

km/h of the velocity change of

− 0

the trolley may be calculated by double integration of the recorded trolley deceleration.

7.7.6.

After impact, the belt assembly or restraint system and its rigid parts shall be inspected visually, without opening the buckle, to determine whether there has been any failure or breakage. In the case of restraint systems it shall also be ascertained, after the test, whether the parts of the vehicle structure which are attached to the trolley have undergone any visible permanent deformation. If there is any such deformation this shall be taken into account in any calculation made in accordance with paragraph 6.4.1.4.1. above.

7.7.7.

However, if the tests were performed at a higher speed and/or the acceleration curve have exceeded the upper level of the hatched area and the safety belt meets the requirements, the test shall be considered satisfactory.

7.8.

Buckle-opening test

7.8.1.

For this test, belt assemblies or restraint devices which have already undergone the dynamic test in conformity with paragraph 7.7. above shall be used.

7.8.2.

The belt assembly shall be removed from the test trolley without the buckle being opened. A load shall be applied to the buckle by direct traction via the straps tied to it so that all the straps are subjected to the force of 60 daN. (It n

is understood that n is the number of straps linked to the buckle when it is in a locked position.) In the case where the buckle is connected to a rigid part, the load shall be applied at the same angle as the one formed by the buckle and the rigid end during the dynamic test. A load shall be applied at a speed of 400 ± 20 mm/min to the geometric centre of the buckle-release button along a fixed axis running parallel to the initial direction of motion of the button.

During the application of the force needed to open the buckle, the buckle shall be held by a rigid support. The load quoted above shall not exceed the limit indicated in paragraph 6.2.2.5. above. The point of contact of the test equipment shall be spherical in form with a radius of 2.5 mm ± 0.1 mm. It shall have a polished metal surface.

7.8.3.

The buckle-opening force shall be measured and any failure of the buckle noted.

7.8.4.

After the buckle-opening test, the components of the belt assembly or of the restraint device which have undergone the tests prescribed in paragraph 7.7.

above shall be inspected and the extent of the damage sustained by the belt assembly or restraint device during the dynamic test shall be recorded in the test report.

7.9.

Additional tests on safety-belts with pre-loading devices

7.9.1.

Conditioning



The pre-loading device may be separated from the safety-belt to be tested and kept for 24 hours at a temperature of 60 ± 5 °C. The temperature shall then be raised to 100 ± 5 °C for two hours. Subsequently it shall be kept for 24 hours at a temperature of -30 ± 5 °C. After being removed from conditioning, the device shall warm up to ambient temperature. If it has been separated it shall be fitted again to the safety-belt.

7.10.

8.4.4.1.

Safety-belt reminders for occupants of rear row(s) shall fulfil the requirements set out in paragraph 8.4.2.

8.4.4.2.

The visual warning shall indicate at least all rear seating positions to allow the driver to identify, while facing forward as seated on the driver seat, any seating position in which the safety-belt is unfastened. For vehicles that have information on the occupancy status of the rear seats, the visual warning does not need to indicate unfastened safety-belts for unoccupied seating positions.

8.4.4.3.

The colour of the visual warning may be other than red and the symbol of the visual warning for safety-belts covered by paragraph 8.4.1.2 may contain different symbols other than defined in UN Regulation No.121.

3.2.

The general anchorages shall be positioned as shown in Figure 1. The marks which correspond to the arrangement of the anchorages show where the ends of the belt are to be connected to the trolley or to the load transducer, as the case may be. The anchorages for normal use are the points A, B and K if the strap length between the upper edge of the buckle and the hole for attachment of the strap support is not more than 250 mm. Otherwise, the points A1 and B1

shall be used. The tolerance on the position of the anchorage points is such that each anchorage point shall be situated at most at 50 mm from corresponding points A, B and K indicated in Figure 1 or A1, B1 and K, as the case may be.

3.3.

The structure carrying the anchorages shall be rigid. The upper anchorage shall not be displaced by more than 0.2 mm in the longitudinal direction when a load of 98 daN is applied to it in that direction. The trolley shall be so constructed that no permanent deformation shall occur in the parts bearing the anchorages during the test.

3.4.

If a fourth anchorage is necessary to attach the retractor, this anchorage: Shall be located in the vertical longitudinal plane passing through K; Shall enable the retractor to be tilted to the angle prescribed by the manufacturer;



Shall be located on the arc of a circle with radius KB1 = 790 mm if the length between the upper strap guide and the strap outlet at the retractor is not less than 540 mm or, in all other cases, on the arc of a circle with centre K and radius 350 mm.

ISOFIX positions in the vehicle, defined by the vehicle manufacturer shall be checked to ensure that the CRF listed in paragraph 4. of this Appendix can be accommodated. Where the vehicle manufacturer has indicated that the ISOFIX

position(s) will accommodate a particular CRF, then it shall be assumed that smaller CRFs of the same orientation may be accommodated.

i-Size seating positions, defined by the vehicle manufacturer, shall be checked to ensure that it is possible to accommodate both the ISO/R2 and the ISO/F2X

child restraint fixtures (see paragraph 4. of this annex) including the i-Size support leg installation assessment volume.

For both, ISOFIX and i-size position(s), the following procedure shall apply: 2.1.

When checking a CRF, on a seat, with or without i-Size support leg installation assessment volume, this seat may be adjusted longitudinally to its rearmost position and in its lowest position.

2.2.

Adjust the seat-back angle to the manufacturer’s design position and the head restraint in the lowest and rearmost position. In the absence of any specification an angle of the seat-back corresponding to a torso angle of 25° from the vertical, or the nearest fixed position of the seat-back, shall be used.



When checking a CRF, on a rear seat, with or without i-Size support leg installation assessment volume, the vehicle seat located in front of this rear seat may be adjusted longitudinally forward but not further than the mid position between its rearmost and fore most positions. The seat backrest angle may also be adjusted, but not to a more upright angle than corresponding to a torso angle of 15°.

2.3.

Place a cotton cloth on the seat-back and cushion.

2.4.

Place the CRF, with or without i-Size support leg installation assessment volume, on the ISOFIX or i-Size position.

2.5.

Push, towards ISOFIX anchorages system, on the center between the ISOFIX

anchorages with a force of 100 N ± 10 N, applied parallel to the lower surface, and remove the force.

Requirements


The following testing conditions only apply for the CRF(s), with or without i-Size support leg installation assessment volume, when accommodated in the ISOFIX and/or i-Size position. It is not required that the CRF(s), with or without i-Size support leg installation assessment volume, shall be able to move in and out of the ISOFIX and/or i-Size position under these conditions.

3.1.

It has to be possible to accommodate the CRF(s), with or without i-Size support leg installation assessment volume, without interference with the vehicle interior. The CRF base shall have a pitch angle of 15° ± 10°, above the horizontal plane passing through the ISOFIX anchorages system. ISOFIX

attachments, according to detail Y of Figures 1 to 9, may adjust longitudinally between -10 mm to +70 mm to facilitate the interference check. The figures are showing the most extended positions.

3.2.

The ISOFIX top tether anchorage, if any, shall remain accessible.

3.3.

Should the above requirements not be met with the adjustments indicated in paragraph 2. above, the seats, the seat-backs, the head restraints may be adjusted to alternative positions designated by the manufacturer for normal use following which the above installation procedure shall be repeated and the requirements verified and met.These alternative positions shall be described in the vehicle handbook and with the additional information specified in Appendix 3 to this annex. Passenger seats in front of i-Size seating positions may also be displaced to a position forward of the normal position of use. In such cases, the vehicle manufacturer shall provide information in the vehicle handbook, that the respective passenger seat shall not be occupied in such positions of displacement.





3.4


Should the above requirements not be fulfilled when some removable interior fittings were present, such fittings may be removed and then requirements of paragraph 3. have to be verified again and fulfilled. In such a case corresponding information shall be included in Table 2 and/or 3 of Appendix 3 of this annex.

General


1.1.

The test procedure and the requirements in this appendix shall be used to determine the suitability of seating positions for the installation of the booster seat fixtures ISO/B2 or ISO/B3, without ISOFIX attachments. Where the vehicle manufacturer has indicated that the vehicle position(s) will accommodate a particular CRF, then it shall be assumed that smaller CRFs of the same orientation will also be accommodated.

1.2.

The tests may be carried out in the vehicle or in a representative part of the vehicle. Compliance with this requirement can be proven by a physical test or computer simulation or representative drawings.





2.


Test procedure


i-Size positions in the vehicle, defined by the vehicle manufacturer, shall be checked to ensure that the ISO/B2 fixture listed in paragraph 4 of this appendix can be accommodated, at least without ISOFIX connections.

2.1.

Adjust the seat to its fully rearward and lowest position.

2.2.

Adjust the seat-back angle to the manufacturer's design position. In the absence of any specification, a torso angle of 25 degrees from the vertical, or the nearest fixed position of the seat-back, should be used.

2.3.

When checking a CRF, on a rear seat, the vehicle seat located in front of this rear seat may be adjusted longitudinally forward but not further than the mid position between its rearmost and fore most positions. The seat backrest angle may also be adjusted, but not to a more upright angle than corresponding to a torso angle of 15°. If the front seat is adjustable in height, adjust to the manufacturer's specification. In the absence of any specification, adjust the front seat to mid height position, or the nearest position to mid height.

2.4.

If necessary, head restraints may be adjusted or removed, if possible.

2.5.

Set the shoulder anchorage to the position defined by the vehicle manufacturer.

2.6.

Place cotton cloths on the seat-back and cushion, if needed.

2.7.

Remove the ISOFIX attachments from the CRF, or retract them to a position fully inside the backseat line (reference line E, Figure 2 or 3).

2.8.

Place the fixture (as described in Figure 2 or 3 of this appendix) on the vehicle seat. The top of the fixture may touch the vehicle roof. Compression of the seat cushion is allowed to move the fixture into position.

2.9.

Arrange the seat belt through the CRF in approximately the correct position, and then fasten the buckle. Ensure that all webbing slack is removed. The fixture shall be restrained by the vehicle’s seat belt.

2.10.

Ensure that the fixture is located with its centreline on the apparent centreline of the seating position ±25 mm with its centreline parallel with the centreline of the vehicle seat. The roll angle α (see Figure 1) shall be within 0º ± 5º

2.11.
