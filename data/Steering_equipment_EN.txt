Introduction



The intention of the Regulation is to establish uniform provisions for the layout and performance of steering systems fitted to vehicles used on the road.

Traditionally the major requirement has been that the main steering system contains a positive mechanical link between the steering control, normally the steering wheel, and the road wheels in order to determine the path of the vehicle. The mechanical link, if amply dimensioned, has been regarded as not being liable to failure.



Advancing technology, coupled with the wish to improve occupant safety by elimination of the mechanical steering column, and the production advantages associated with easier transfer of the steering control between left and right hand drive vehicles, has led to a review of the traditional approach and the Regulation is now amended to take account of the new technologies.

Accordingly it will now be possible to have steering systems in which there is not any positive mechanical connection between the steering control and the road wheels.



Systems whereby the driver remains in primary control of the vehicle but may be helped by the steering system being influenced by signals initiated on-board the vehicle are defined as "Advanced Driver Assistance Steering Systems".

Such systems can incorporate an "Automatically Commanded Steering Function", for example, using passive infrastructure features to assist the driver in keeping the vehicle on an ideal path (Lane Guidance, Lane Keeping or Heading Control), to assist the driver in manoeuvring the vehicle at low speed in confined spaces or to assist the driver in coming to rest at a pre-defined point (Bus Stop Guidance). Advanced Driver Assistance Steering Systems can also incorporate a "Corrective Steering Function" that, for example, warns the driver of any deviation from the chosen lane (Lane Departure Warning), corrects the steering angle to prevent departure from the chosen lane (Lane Departure Avoidance) or corrects the steering angle of one or more wheels to improve the vehicle's dynamic behaviour or stability.



In the case of any Advanced Driver Assistance Steering System, the driver can, at all times, choose to override the assistance function by deliberate action, for example, to avoid an unforeseen object in the road.



It is anticipated that future technology will also allow steering to be influenced or controlled by sensors and signals generated either on or off-board the vehicle. This has led to several concerns regarding responsibility for the primary control of the vehicle and the absence of any internationally agreed data transmission protocols with respect to off-board or external control of steering. Therefore, the Regulation does not permit the general approval of systems that incorporate functions by which the steering can be controlled by external signals, for example, transmitted from roadside beacons or active features embedded into the road surface. Such systems, which do not require the presence of a driver, have been defined as "Autonomous Steering Systems".



This Regulation also prevents the approval of positive steering of trailers by means of electrical control from the towing vehicle as there are currently no standards applicable to this application. It is expected that at some time in the future, ISO 11992 will be amended to include messages associated with the transmission of steering control.

Unless otherwise specified, it will be assumed that for the purpose of this Regulation, not more than one failure can occur in the steering equipment at any one time and two axles on one bogie shall be considered as one axle.

5.1.5.

The effectiveness of the steering equipment, including the electrical control lines, shall not be adversely affected by magnetic or electric fields. This shall

be demonstrated by fulfilling the technical requirements and respecting the transitional provisions of UN Regulation No. 10 by applying: (a)

The 03 series of amendments for vehicles without a coupling system for charging the Rechargeable Electric Energy Storage System (traction batteries);

(b)

The 04 series of amendments for vehicles with a coupling system for charging the Rechargeable Electric Energy Storage System (traction batteries).

5.1.6.

Advanced driver assistance steering systems shall only be approved in accordance with this Regulation where the function does not cause any deterioration in the performance of the basic steering system. In addition they shall be designed such that the driver may, at any time and by deliberate action, override the function.

5.1.6.1.

A CSF system shall be subject to the requirements of Annex 6.

5.1.6.1.1.

Every CSF intervention shall immediately be indicated to the driver by an optical warning signal which is displayed for at least 1 s or as long as the intervention exists, whichever is longer.

When a flashing mode is used, a lighting phase shall be visible at the end of the intervention or later.

12

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



In the case of a CSF intervention which is controlled by an Electronic Stability Control (ESC) or a Vehicle Stability Function as specified in the relevant UN

Regulation (i.e. UN Regulations Nos. 13, 13-H or 140), the ESC flashing tell-tale indicating the interventions of ESC may be used, as long as the intervention exists, as an alternative to the optical warning signal specified above.

5.1.6.1.2.

In the case of a CSF intervention which is based on the evaluation of the presence and location of lane markings or boundaries of the lane the following shall apply additionally:

5.1.6.1.2.1.

In the case of an intervention longer than:

(a)

10 s for vehicles of category M1 and N1, or

(b)

30 s for vehicles of category M2, M3 and N2, N3,



an acoustic warning signal shall be provided until the end of the intervention.

5.1.6.1.2.2.

In the case of two or more consecutive interventions within a rolling interval of 180 seconds and in the absence of a steering input by the driver during the intervention, an acoustic warning signal shall be provided by the system during the second and any further intervention within a rolling interval of 180 seconds. Starting with the third intervention (and subsequent interventions) the acoustic warning signal shall continue for at least 10 seconds longer than the previous warning signal.

5.1.6.1.2.3.

For vehicles of categories M2 and M3 equipped with a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) fulfilling the technical requirements of Regulation No. 130, the acoustic warning signal specified in paragraphs 5.1.6.1.2.1. and 5.1.6.1.2.2.

may be replaced by a haptic warning, provided it is not solely given via the steering wheel.

5.1.6.1.3.

The steering control effort necessary to override the directional control provided by the system shall not exceed 50 N in the whole range of CSF

operations.

5.1.6.1.4.

The requirements in paragraphs 5.1.6.1.1., 5.1.6.1.2. and 5.1.6.1.3. for CSF, which are reliant on the evaluation of the presence and location of lane markings or boundaries of the lane, shall be tested in accordance with the relevant vehicle test(s) specified in Annex 8 to this Regulation.

5.1.6.2.

Vehicles equipped with an ESF shall fulfil the following requirements.

An ESF system shall be subject to the requirements of Annex 6.

5.1.6.2.1.

Any ESF shall only start an intervention in the case where a risk of a collision is detected.

5.1.6.2.2

Any vehicle fitted with ESF shall be equipped with means to monitor the driving environment (e.g. lane markings, road edge, other road users) in line with the specified use case. These means shall monitor the driving environment at any time the ESF is active.

5.1.6.2.3.

An automatic avoidance manoeuvre initiated by an ESF shall not lead the vehicle to leave the road.

5.1.6.2.3.1.

In the case of an ESF intervention on a road or a lane delimited with lane markings on one or both side(s), an automatic avoidance manoeuver initiated by an ESF shall not lead the vehicle to cross a lane marking. However, if the intervention starts during a lane change performed by the driver or during an unintentional drift into the adjacent lane, the system may steer the vehicle back into its original lane of travel.

5.1.6.2.3.2.

In the absence of a lane marking on one or on both side(s) of the vehicle, a single ESF intervention is permitted, provided that it does not produce a lateral offset of the vehicle greater than 0.75 m in a direction where the lane marking 13

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



is absent. The lateral offset during the automatic avoidance manoeuvre shall be determined using a fixed point on the front of the vehicle at the start and at the conclusion of the ESF intervention.

5.1.6.2.4.

The ESF intervention shall not lead the vehicle to collide with another road user.4

5.1.6.2.5.

The manufacturer shall demonstrate during type approval, to the satisfaction of the Technical Service, which means to monitor the driving environment are fitted to the vehicle to satisfy the provisions in the subparagraphs of paragraph 5.1.6.2. above.

5.1.6.2.6.

Any intervention of an ESF shall be indicated to the driver with an optical and with an acoustic or haptic warning signal to be provided at the latest with the start of the ESF intervention and maintained as long as the intervention exists.

For this purpose appropriate signals used by other warning systems (e.g. blind spot detection, lane departure warning, forward collision warning) are deemed to be sufficient to fulfil the requirements for the respective optical, acoustic or haptic signals above.

5.1.6.2.7.

A system failure shall be indicated to the driver with an optical warning signal.

However, when the system is manually deactivated, the indication of failure mode may be suppressed.

5.1.6.2.8.

The steering control effort necessary to override the directional control provided by the system shall not exceed 50 N.

5.1.6.2.9.

The vehicle shall be tested in accordance with the relevant vehicle tests specified in Annex 8 to this Regulation.

5.1.6.2.10.

System information data

The following data shall be provided, together with the documentation package required in Annex 6 to this Regulation, to the Technical Service at the time of type approval:

Use case(s) where ESF is designed to operate (among the use cases a i, a ii, a iii and b. specified in the ESF definition in paragraph 2.3.4.3.), (b)

The conditions under which the system is active, e.g. the vehicle speed range Vsmax , Vsmin,

(c)

How ESF detects a risk of a collision,

(d)

Description of the means to detect the driving environment, (e)

How to deactivate/reactivate the function,

(f)

How it is ensured that the overriding force does not exceed the limit of 50 N.

5.1.6.3.

Vehicles equipped with an RMF shall fulfil the following requirements.



An RMF system shall be subject to the requirements of Annex 6.

5.1.6.3.1.

Any RMF shall start an intervention only:

(a)

If the driver is either directly (e.g. through a driver monitoring system) or indirectly (e.g. prolonged failed response to a warning, failure to control the vehicle) assessed to be unresponsive; or

(b)

If it is manually activated.





4 Until uniform test procedures have been agreed, the manufacturer shall provide the Technical Service with documentation and supporting evidence to demonstrate compliance with this provision. This information shall be subject to discussion and agreement between the Technical Service and the vehicle manufacturer.

14

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



If the system provides a means for manual activation, this means shall be protected against unintentional operation and accessible to the driver and to passengers adjacent to the driver.

5.1.6.3.2.

Unless a request for action (e.g. hands-on warning) was already given or the system was manually activated, there shall be an optical and additionally an acoustic and/or haptic (e.g. brake jerks) warning signal before every RMF

intervention in order to stimulate the driver to take back control.

This warning phase shall start at least 5 seconds before the RMF starts an intervention, unless vehicle control by the system is required sooner to prevent the vehicle from crossing the lane markings or to keep an appropriate distance to other vehicles.

Every RMF intervention shall be indicated to the driver by an optical and additionally an acoustic and/or haptic (e.g. brake jerks) warning signal for as long as the intervention exists.

These warning signals shall be distinct and of a great urgency.

5.1.6.3.3.

An RMF intervention shall not unreasonably deactivate or suppress the functionality of activated assistance systems (e.g. AEBS).

5.1.6.3.4.

The signal to activate the hazard warning lights shall be generated with the start of the intervention.

5.1.6.3.5.

It shall be possible to override the RMF intervention of the function at any time by a distinct action of the driver.

The RMF shall implement strategies to provide protection against unintentional override by inputs to the driving controls (e.g. by requiring a significant change in a single input to the accelerator or brake pedal or multiple inputs to override the RMF).



These strategies shall be demonstrated to the Technical Service at the time of type approval.

5.1.6.3.6.

During the RMF intervention the vehicle shall slow down with a deceleration demand not greater than 4m/s², unless required by the surrounding traffic (e.g.

a decelerating lead vehicle).

Higher deceleration demand values are also permissible for very short durations, e.g. as haptic warning to stimulate the driver to take back control.

5.1.6.3.7.

Once the RMF has brought the vehicle to a safe stop in the target stop area, the vehicle shall not move away without manual input.

5.1.6.3.8.

If the RMF system detects any failures preventing it from performing an intervention, this shall be signalled to the driver.

5.1.6.3.9.

Additional provisions for systems with the purpose of bringing the vehicle to a safe stop outside its own lane of travel.

5.1.6.3.9.1.

The RMF shall only be permitted to change lanes, if the vehicle is equipped with detection capabilities to the front, side and rear.

5.1.6.3.9.2.

Lane change procedures shall only be performed in an uncritical way as described in paragraphs 5.1.6.3.9.7. and 5.1.6.3.9.8. In case the target stop area cannot be reached in an uncritical way the RMF shall aim to keep the vehicle within its current lane of travel while the vehicle is stopping.

5.1.6.3.9.3.

Before initiating a lane change procedure, RMF shall, if deemed appropriate, reduce the vehicle speed to minimize the risk related to that lane change (e.g.

by adapting the speed of the vehicle to that of other vehicles in the target lane).

A lane change procedure shall not start within the first 5s following the start of the RMF intervention.

15

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



5.1.6.3.9.4.

During the intervention the system may perform a single or multiple lane change(s) across regular lanes of traffic and/or to the hard shoulder. Lane changes shall be made only if under the traffic situation these lane changes can be considered to minimize the risk to safety of the vehicle occupants and other road users.

5.1.6.3.9.5.

A lane change during the intervention shall only be performed if the system has sufficient information about its surrounding to the front, side and rear (as defined in paragraph 5.1.6.3.9.17.) in order to assess the criticality of that lane change.

5.1.6.3.9.6.

A lane change during the intervention shall not be performed towards a lane intended for traffic moving in the opposite direction.

5.1.6.3.9.7.

The intervention shall not cause a collision with another vehicle or road user in the predicted path of the vehicle during a lane change.

5.1.6.3.9.8.

A lane change procedure shall be predictable and manageable for other road users.

5.1.6.3.9.8.1. During the lane change manoeuvre, the RMF shall aim to avoid a lateral acceleration of more than 1 m/s2 in addition to the lateral acceleration generated by the lane curvature.

5.1.6.3.9.8.2. A lane change manoeuvre shall only be started if a vehicle in the target lane is not forced to unmanageably decelerate due to the lane change of the vehicle.

5.1.6.3.9.8.2.1. During the lane change manoeuvre, RMF shall aim to avoid inducing a longitudinal deceleration of more than 3.7 m/s2 for a vehicle approaching from the rear.

5.1.6.3.9.8.2.2. A lane change manoeuvre shall only be started if there is sufficient space to a vehicle following behind or approaching from the rear in the adjacent lane.

5.1.6.3.9.8.2.3. In case the RMF decelerates the vehicle during a lane change procedure, this deceleration shall be factored in when assessing the distance to a vehicle approaching from the rear, and the deceleration shall be manageable for the vehicle approaching from the rear.

5.1.6.3.9.8.2.4. Where there is not sufficient headway time for the vehicle behind at the end of the lane change procedure, the RMF shall not increase the rate of deceleration for a certain period of time after the completion of the lane change procedure except for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating the risk of an imminent collision.

5.1.6.3.9.8.2.5. How the provisions of paragraph 5.1.6.3.9.8.2. and its subparagraphs are implemented in the system design shall be demonstrated to the Technical Service during type approval.

5.1.6.3.9.9.

The lane change manoeuvre shall aim to be one continuous movement.

5.1.6.3.9.10.

A lane change during the intervention shall be completed without undue delay.

5.1.6.3.9.11.

A lane change manoeuvre shall only be started if the manoeuvre is anticipated to be completed before the vehicle comes to a standstill (i.e. in order to avoid coming to standstill while in the middle of two regular lanes due to stopped traffic ahead).

5.1.6.3.9.12

Additional provisions for system behaviour for the vehicle’s final lane change during a lane change manoeuvre that is bringing the vehicle to a safe stop beside the road.

5.1.6.3.9.12.1. All provisions of paragraph 5.1.6.3.9. shall be applied except 5.1.6.3.9.11., 5.1.6.3.9.13., 5.1.6.3.9.14. and 5.1.6.3. 9.16.

5.1.6.3.9.12.2. The vehicle may come to a standstill on the lane mark beside the road.

16

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



5.1.6.3.9.12.3. In addition to the provisions of paragraph 5.1.6.3.9.7., an acoustic warning may be given as warning to other road users unless traffic rules in the country prohibits using an acoustic warning.

5.1.6.3.9.12.4. When bringing the vehicle to a stop beside the road the vehicle speed shall not exceed 10 km/h.

5.1.6.3.9.13. A lane change manoeuvre during an intervention shall be indicated in advance to other road users by activating the appropriate direction indicator lamps instead of the hazard warning lights.

5.1.6.3.9.14. Once the lane change manoeuvre is completed the direction indicator lamps shall be deactivated in a timely manner, and the hazard warning lights shall become active again.

5.1.6.3.9.15. (Reserved).

5.1.6.3.9.16. Notwithstanding paragraph 5.1.6.3.9.14. when several consecutive lane changes are performed as part of the RMF intervention, the direction indicator may remain active throughout these lane changes while the lateral behaviour shall ensure that each lane change manoeuvre can be perceived as an individual manoeuvre by following traffic.

5.1.6.3.9.17. If the vehicle is equipped with the capability to perform lane changes during the RMF intervention, the manufacturer shall declare the detection ranges to the front, side and rear. The declared ranges shall be sufficient to assess that a change into a lane immediately to the left or to the right of the vehicle does not cause a critical situation with another vehicle or road user during a lane change.

The Technical Service shall assess the correspondence of declared detection ranges and lane change strategy and shall verify that the vehicle’s sensing system detects vehicles during the relevant test in Annex 8. These ranges shall be equal or greater than the declared ranges.

5.1.6.3.10.

The system shall implement strategies to draw external attention to the emergency situation (e.g. triggering an emergency call, activating the horn, keeping the hazard warning lights active), when the driver remains unresponsive once RMF has brought the vehicle to standstill.

5.1.6.3.11.

Special provisions for M2/M3 vehicles

5.1.6.3.11.1. In case the system provides a means for manual activation by a passenger, the RMF system shall provide an indication to this passenger upon activation of the RMF. This indication shall continue until the RMF intervention starts or the activation is overridden by the driver. The driver shall be enabled to override the request from the passenger in order to suppress the RMF

intervention.

5.1.6.3.11.2. An RMF fitted to a vehicle of Class I, II or A as defined in the Consolidated Resolution on the Construction of Vehicles (R.E.3) shall provide an acoustic and optical indication to the passengers before the intervention would start.

5.1.6.3.12

5.1.8.2.

Steering transmission which can be disconnected to cover different configurations of a vehicle (e.g. on extendable semi-trailers), shall have locking devices which ensure positive relocation of components; where locking is automatic, there shall be an additional safety lock which is operated manually.

5.1.9.

Steered wheels



The steered wheels shall not be solely the rear wheels. This requirement does not apply to semi-trailers.

5.1.10.

Energy supply



The same energy supply may be used for the steering equipment and other systems. However, in the case of a failure in any system which shares the same energy supply steering shall be ensured in accordance with the relevant failure conditions of paragraph 5.3.

5.1.11.

Control systems



The requirements of Annex 6 shall be applied to the safety aspects of electronic vehicle control systems that provide or form part of the control transmission of the steering function including advanced driver assistance steering systems.

However, systems or functions, that use the steering system as the means of achieving a higher level objective, are subject to Annex 6 only insofar as they have a direct effect on the steering system. If such systems are provided, they shall not be deactivated during type approval testing of the steering system.

5.2.

Special provisions for trailers

18

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



5.2.1.

Trailers (with the exception of semi-trailers and centre-axle trailers) which have more than one axle with steered wheels and semi-trailers and centre-axle trailers which have at least one axle with steered wheels shall fulfil the conditions given in paragraph 6.3. However, for trailers with self-tracking steering equipment a test under paragraph 6.3. is not necessary if the axle load ratio between the un-steered and the self-tracking axles equals or exceeds 1.6.

5.3.

Failure provisions and performance

5.3.1.

General

5.3.1.1.

For the purposes of this Regulation the steered wheels, the steering control and all mechanical parts of the steering transmission shall not be regarded as liable to breakage if they are amply dimensioned, are readily accessible for maintenance, and exhibit safety features at least equal to those prescribed for other essential components (such as the braking system) of the vehicle. Where the failure of any such part would be likely to result in loss of control of the vehicle, that part shall be made of metal or of a material with equivalent characteristics and shall not be subject to significant distortion in normal operation of the steering system.

5.3.1.2.

The requirements of paragraphs 5.1.2., 5.1.3. and 6.2.1. shall also be satisfied with a failure in the steering equipment as long as the vehicle can be driven with the speeds required in the respective paragraphs.



In this case paragraph 5.1.3. shall not apply for full power steering systems when the vehicle is stationary.

5.3.1.3.

Any failure in a transmission other than purely mechanical shall clearly be brought to the attention of the vehicle driver as given in paragraph 5.4. When a failure occurs, a change in the average steering ratio is permissible if the steering effort given in paragraph 6.2.6. is not exceeded.

5.3.1.4.

In the case where the braking system of the vehicle shares the same energy source as the steering system and this energy source fails, the steering system shall have priority and shall be capable of meeting the requirements of paragraphs 5.3.2. and 5.3.3. as applicable. In addition the braking performance on the first subsequent application, shall not drop below the prescribed service brake performance, as given in paragraph 2. of Annex 3 to this Regulation.

5.3.1.5.

In the case where the braking system of the vehicle shares the same energy supply as the steering system and there is a failure in the energy supply, the steering system shall have priority and shall be capable of meeting the requirements of paragraphs 5.3.2. and 5.3.3. as applicable. In addition the braking performance on the first subsequent application shall comply with the prescriptions of paragraph 3. of Annex 3 to this Regulation.

5.3.1.6.

The requirements for the braking performance in paragraphs 5.3.1.4. and 5.3.1.5. above shall not apply if the braking system is such that in the absence of any energy reserve it is possible with the service brake control to achieve the safety requirement for the secondary braking system mentioned in: (a)

Paragraph 2.2. of UN Regulation No. 13-H, Annex 3 (for M1 and N1

vehicles);

19

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



(b)

Paragraph 2.2. of UN Regulation No. 13, Annex 4 (for M2, M3 and N

vehicles).

5.3.1.7.

In the case of trailers the requirements of paragraphs 5.2.2. and 6.3.4.1. shall also be met when there is a failure in the steering system.

5.3.2.

Power assisted steering systems

5.3.2.1.

Should the engine stop or a part of the transmission fail, with the exception of those parts listed in paragraph 5.3.1.1., there shall be no immediate changes in steering angle. As long as the vehicle is capable of being driven at a speed greater than 10 km/h the requirements given in paragraph 6., relating to a system with a failure, shall be met.

5.3.3.

Full power steering systems

5.3.3.1.

The system shall be designed such that the vehicle cannot be driven indefinitively at speeds above 10 km/h where there is any fault which requires operation of the warning signal referred to in paragraph 5.4.2.1.1.

5.3.3.2.

In case of a failure within the control transmission, with the exception of those parts listed in paragraph 5.1.4., it shall still be possible to steer with the performance laid down in paragraph 6. for the intact steering system.

5.3.3.3.

In the event of a failure of the energy source of the control transmission, it shall be possible to carry out at least 24 "figure of eight" manoeuvres, where each loop of the figure is 40 m diameter at 10 km/h speed and at the performance level given for an intact system in paragraph 6. The test manoeuvres shall begin at an energy storage level given in paragraph 5.3.3.5.

5.3.3.4.

In the event of a failure within the energy transmission, with the exception of those parts listed in paragraph 5.3.1.1., there shall not be any immediate changes in steering angle. As long as the vehicle is capable of being driven at a speed greater than 10 km/h the requirements of paragraph 6. for the system with a failure shall be met after the completion of at least 25 "figure of eight"

manoeuvres at 10 km/h minimum speed, where each loop of the figure is 40 m diameter.



The test manoeuvres shall begin at an energy storage level given in paragraph 5.3.3.5.

5.3.3.5.

The energy level to be used for the tests referred to in paragraphs 5.3.3.3. and 5.3.3.4. shall be the energy storage level at which a failure is indicated to the driver.



In the case of electrically powered systems subject to Annex 6, this level shall be the worst case situation outlined by the manufacturer in the documentation submitted in connection with Annex 6 and shall take into account the effects of e.g. temperature and ageing on battery performance.

5.4.

Warning signals

5.4.1.

General provisions

5.4.1.1.

Any fault which impairs the steering function and is not mechanical in nature shall be signalled clearly to the driver of the vehicle.



Despite the requirements of paragraph 5.1.2. the deliberate application of vibration in the steering system may be used as an additional indication of a fault condition in this system.



In the case of a motor vehicle, an increase in steering force is considered to be a warning indication; in the case of a trailer, a mechanical indicator is permitted.

5.4.1.2.

Optical warning signals shall be visible, even by daylight and distinguishable from other alerts; the satisfactory condition of the signals shall be easily 20

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



verifiable by the driver from the driver's seat; the failure of a component of the warning devices shall not entail any loss of the steering system's performance.

5.4.1.3.

Acoustic warning signals shall be by continuous or intermittent sound signal or by vocal information. Where vocal information is employed, the manufacturer shall ensure that the alert uses the language(s) of the market into which the vehicle is sold.



Acoustic warning signals shall be easily recognized by the driver.

5.4.1.4.

If the same energy source is used to supply the steering system and other systems, an acoustic or optical warning shall be given to the driver, when the stored energy/fluid in the energy/storage reservoir drops to a level liable to cause an increase in steering effort. This warning may be combined with a device provided to warn of brake failure if the brake system uses the same energy source. The satisfactory condition of the warning device shall be easily verifiable by the driver.

5.4.2.

Special provisions for full-power steering equipment

5.4.2.1.

Power-driven vehicles shall be capable of providing steering failure and defect warning signals, as follows:

5.4.2.1.1.

A red warning signal, indicating failures defined in paragraph 5.3.1.3. within the main steering equipment;

5.4.2.1.2.

Where applicable, a yellow warning signal indicating an electrically detected defect within the steering equipment, which is not indicated by the red warning signal;

5.4.2.1.3.

If a symbol is used, it shall comply with symbol J 04, ISO/IEC registration number 7000-2441 as defined in ISO 2575:2000;

5.4.2.1.4.

The warning signal(s) mentioned above shall light up when the electrical equipment of the vehicle (and the steering system) is energised. With the vehicle stationary, the steering system shall verify that none of the specified failures or defects is present before extinguishing the signal.



Specified failures or defects which should activate the warning signal mentioned above, but which are not detected under static conditions, shall be stored upon detection and be displayed at start-up and at all times when the ignition (start) switch is in the "on" (run) position, as long as the failure persists.

5.4.3.

It is recognised that the maximum lateral acceleration specified by the vehicle manufacturer aysmax may not be achievable under all conditions (e.g. inclement weather, different tyres fitted to the vehicle, laterally sloped roads). The system shall not deactivate or unreasonably switch the control strategy in these other conditions.

The system may exceed the specified value aysmax by not more than 0.3 m/s², while not exceeding the maximum value specified in the table in paragraph 5.6.2.1.3. of this Regulation.

Notwithstanding the sentence above, for time periods of not more than 2 s the lateral acceleration of the system may exceed the specified value aysmax by not more than 40 per cent, while not exceeding the maximum value specified in the table in paragraph 5.6.2.1.3. of this Regulation by more than 0.3 m/s2.

5.6.2.1.2.

The vehicle shall be equipped with a means for the driver to activate (standby mode) and deactivate (off mode) the system. It shall be possible to deactivate the system at any time by a single action of the driver. Following this action, the system shall only become active again as a result of a deliberate action by the driver.

5.6.2.1.3.

The system shall be designed so that excessive intervention of steering control is suppressed to ensure the steering operability by the driver and to avoid unexpected vehicle behaviour, during its operation. To ensure this, the following requirements shall be fulfilled:

When the system reaches its boundary conditions set out in paragraph 5.6.2.3.1.1. of this Regulation (e.g. the specified maximum lateral acceleration aysmax) and both in the absence of any driver input to the steering control and when any front tyre of the vehicle starts to cross the lane marking, the system shall continue to provide assistance and shall clearly inform the driver about this system status by an optical warning signal and additionally by an acoustic or haptic warning signal.

For vehicles of categories M2 M3 N2 and N3, the warning requirement above is deemed to be fulfilled if the vehicle is equipped with a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) fulfilling the technical requirements of UN

Regulation No. 130.

5.6.2.2.4.

A system failure shall be signalled to the driver by an optical warning signal.

However, when the system is manually deactivated by the driver, the indication of the failure may be suppressed.

5.6.2.2.5.

When the system is active and in the speed range between 10 km/h or V smin, whichever is higher, and V smax, it shall provide a means of detecting that the driver is holding the steering control.

If, after a period of no longer than 15 seconds the driver is not holding the steering control, an optical warning signal shall be provided. This signal may be the same as the signal specified below in this paragraph.

The optical warning signal shall indicate to the driver to place their hands on the steering control. It shall consist of pictorial information showing hands and 24



E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



the steering control and may be accompanied by additional explanatory text or warning symbols - see examples below:





If, after a period of no longer than 30 seconds the driver is not holding the steering control, at least the hands or steering control in the pictorial information provided as optical warning signal shall be shown in red and an acoustic warning signal shall be provided.

The warning signals shall be active until the driver is holding the steering control, or until the system is deactivated, either manually or automatically.

The system shall be automatically deactivated at the latest 30 seconds after the acoustic warning signal has started. After deactivation the system shall clearly inform the driver about the system status by an acoustic emergency signal which is different from the previous acoustic warning signal, for at least five seconds or until the driver holds the steering control again.

The above requirements shall be tested in accordance with the relevant vehicle test(s) specified in Annex 8 to this Regulation.

5.6.2.2.6.

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5



deemed reasonable due to the situation or resulting from driver input (e.g.

when another vehicle is driving close beside).



This shall be demonstrated by the vehicle manufacturer to the Technical Service during type approval.

5.6.4.2.

Activation/deactivation of the ACSF of Category C system

5.6.4.2.1.

The default status of the system shall be off at the initiation of each new engine start/run cycle.



This requirement does not apply when a new engine start/run cycle is performed automatically, e.g. the operation of a stop/start system.

5.6.4.2.2.

The vehicle shall be equipped with a means for the driver to activate (standby mode) and deactivate (off mode) the system. The same means as for an ACSF

of Category B1 may be used.

5.6.4.2.3.

The system shall only be activated (standby mode) after a deliberate action by the driver.



Activation by the driver shall only be possible on roads where pedestrians and cyclists are prohibited and which, by design, are equipped with a physical separation that divides the traffic moving in opposite directions and which have at least two lanes in the direction the vehicles are driving. These conditions shall be ensured by the use of at least two independent means.



In the case of a transition from a road type with a classification permitting an ACSF of Category C, to a type of road where an ACSF of Category C is not permitted, the system shall be deactivated automatically (off mode), unless a missing second lane in driving direction is the only condition not fulfilled from the above (e.g. a connector between two highways).

5.6.4.2.4.

It shall be possible to deactivate the system (off mode) at any time by a single action of the driver. Following this action, the system shall only be able to be reactivated (standby mode) by a deliberate action of the driver.

5.6.4.5.3.

When the lane change procedure is ongoing an optical signal shall be provided to the driver.

5.6.4.5.4.

When the lane change procedure is suppressed, in accordance with paragraph 5.6.4.6.8., the system shall clearly inform the driver about this system status by an optical warning signal and additionally by an acoustic or haptic warning signal. In case the suppression is initiated by the driver, an optical warning is sufficient.

5.6.4.5.5.

A system failure shall be signalled immediately to the driver by an optical warning signal. However, when the system is manually deactivated by the driver, the indication of failure mode may be suppressed.



If a system failure occurs during a lane change manoeuvre, the failure shall be signalled to the driver by an optical, and an acoustic or haptic warning.

5.6.4.5.6.

The system shall provide a means of detecting that the driver is holding the steering control and shall warn the driver in accordance with the warning strategy below:



If, after a period of no longer than 3s after the initiation of the lane change procedure and before the start of the lane change manoeuvre, the driver is not holding the steering control, an optical warning signal shall be provided. This signal shall be the same as the signal specified in paragraph 5.6.2.2.5. above.



The warning signal shall be active until the driver is holding the steering control, or until the system is deactivated, either manually or automatically according to 5.6.4.6.8.

5.6.4.6.

Lane Change Procedure

5.6.4.6.1.

The initiation of a lane change procedure of an ACSF of Category C shall only be possible if an ACSF of Category B1 is already active.

5.6.4.6.2.

The lane change procedure requires, and shall start immediately after, a manual activation by the driver of the direction indicator to the intended side for the lane change.

5.6.4.6.3.

When the lane change procedure starts, the ACSF of Category B1 shall be suspended and the ACSF of Category C shall carry on the lane keeping function of ACSF of category B1, until the lane change manoeuvre starts.

5.6.4.6.4.

The lateral movement of the vehicle towards the intended lane shall not start earlier than 1.0 second after the start of the lane change procedure.

Additionally, the lateral movement to approach the lane marking and the lateral movement necessary to complete the lane change manoeuvre, shall be completed as one continuous movement.



The lane change manoeuvre shall be initiated either automatically or by a second deliberate action of the driver. A vehicle shall not be equipped with both these means of initiation.

5.6.4.6.4.1.

Automatic initiation of the lane change manoeuvre

In case of an automatic initiation the lane change manoeuvre shall commence between 3.0 seconds and 5.0 seconds after the manual activation of the procedure as described in paragraph 5.6.4.6.2. and shown in the Figure below.



27





E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5





5.6.4.6.4.2.

Initiation of the lane change manoeuvre by a second deliberate action In case of an initiation by a second deliberate action the lane change manoeuvre shall commence between 3.0 and 7.0 seconds after the manual activation of the procedure as described in paragraph 5.6.4.6.2.

Additionally, the lane change manoeuvre shall commence at the latest 3.0 seconds after the second deliberate action as shown in the Figure below.

5.6.4.6.7.

The direction indicator shall remain active throughout the whole period of the lane change manoeuvre and shall be automatically deactivated by the system no later than 0.5 seconds after the resumption of ACSF of Category B1 lane keeping function as described in paragraph 5.6.4.6.6. above. Automatic deactivation by the system of the direction indicator is required only if the lane change manoeuvre is initiated automatically, and if the direction indicator control is not fully engaged (latched position) during the lane change manoeuvre.

5.6.4.6.8.

Suppression of the Lane Change Procedure

5.6.4.6.8.1.

The lane change procedure shall be suppressed automatically by the system when at least one of the following situations occurs before the lane change manoeuvre has started:

The system has detected that the driver is not holding the steering control at the start of the lane change manoeuvre,



(e)

The direction indicator lamps are manually deactivated by the driver; (f)

Following the deliberate action of the driver to start the procedure described in paragraph 5.6.4.6.2., the lane change manoeuvre has not commenced:

(i)

At the latest after 5.0 seconds, in the case of an automatic initiation,

(ii) At the latest after 7.0 seconds, in the case of an initiation by a second deliberate action,



(iii) At the latest after 3.0 seconds after the second deliberate action, in the case of an initiation by a second deliberate action,

whatever is appropriate

(g)

The system, with an initiation of the lane change manoeuvre by a second deliberate action, has not detected the second deliberate action at the latest 5.0 seconds after the start of the lane change procedure.



(h)

The lateral movement described in paragraph 5.6.4.6.4. is not continuous.

5.6.4.6.8.2.

Manual deactivation of the lane change procedure, using the manual control of the direction indicator, shall be possible for the driver at any time.

5.6.4.7.

Critical situation





A situation is deemed to be critical when, at the time a lane change manoeuvre starts, an approaching vehicle in the target lane would have to decelerate at a higher level than 3m/s², 0.4 seconds after the lane change manoeuvre has started, to ensure the distance between the two vehicles is never less than that which the lane change vehicle travels in 1 second.



The resulting critical distance at the start of the lane change manoeuvre shall be calculated using the following formula:

S critical = (vrear - vACSF) * tB + (vrear - vACSF)2 / (2 * a) + vACSF * tG



Where:

vrear

is

The actual speed of the approaching vehicle or 130 km/h whatever value is lower

vACSF is

The actual speed of the ACSF vehicle

a

=

3 m/s²

(Deceleration of the approaching vehicle)

tB

=

0.4 s

(Time after the start of the lane change manoeuvre at

which the deceleration of the approaching vehicle

starts)

tG

=

1 s

(Remaining gap of the vehicles after the deceleration

of the approaching vehicle).

5.6.4.8.

Minimum distance and minimum operation speed

5.6.4.8.1.

The ACSF of Category C shall be able to detect vehicles approaching from the rear in an adjacent lane up to a distance Srear as specified below: 29



E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5





The minimum distance Srear shall be declared by the vehicle manufacturer. The declared value shall not be less than 55 m.



The declared distance shall be tested according to the relevant test in Annex 8

using a two-wheeled motor vehicle of Category L 1

3 as the approaching vehicle.



The minimum operation speed Vsmin , down to which the ACSF of Category C

is permitted to perform a lane change manoeuvre, shall be calculated with minimum distance Srear using the following formula:

𝑉𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 𝑎 ∗ (𝑡𝐵 − 𝑡𝐺) + 𝑣𝑎𝑝𝑝 − √𝑎2 ∗ (𝑡𝐵 − 𝑡𝐺)2 − 2 ∗ 𝑎 ∗ (𝑣𝑎𝑝𝑝 ∗ 𝑡𝐺 − 𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑟) Where:

Srear

is The minimum distance declared by the manufacturer in [m]; Vapp

= 36.1 m/s

(The speed of the approaching vehicle is

130 km/h i.e. 36.1 m/s);

a

= 3 m/s²

(Deceleration of the approaching vehicle);

tB

= 0.4 s

(Time after the start of the manoeuvre at which the deceleration of the approaching vehicle starts);

tG

= 1 s

(Remaining gap of the vehicles after the deceleration

of the approaching vehicle);

Vsmin in [m/s] is

The resulting minimum activation speed of the ACSF of

Category C.



If the vehicle is operated in a country with a general maximum speed limit below 130 km/h, this speed limit may be used as an alternative for Vapp in the above formula to calculate the minimum operation speed Vsmin. In this case the vehicle shall be equipped with a means to detect the country of the operation and shall have information available on the general maximum speed limit of this country.



Notwithstanding the requirements above in this paragraph, the ACSF of Category C is permitted to perform a lane change manoeuvre at speeds lower than the calculated Vsmin provided that the following conditions are met: (a)

The system has detected another vehicle in the adjacent lane into which the lane change is planned at a distance lower than Srear ; and (b)

The situation is not deemed to be critical according to paragraph 5.6.4.7. (e.g. at low speed differences and Vapp< 130 km/h); (c)

The declared value Srear is greater than the calculated value Scritical from paragraph 5.6.4.7. above.

5.6.4.8.2.

The vehicle system detection area on ground level shall be at minimum as shown in the figure below.

5.6.4.8.4.

The ACSF of Category C shall be able to detect blindness of the sensor (e.g.

due to accumulation of dirt, ice or snow). The ACSF of Category C shall be prevented, upon detection of blindness, from performing the lane change manoeuvre. The status of the system shall be signalled to the driver no later than on the initiation of the lane change procedure. The same warning as the one specified in paragraph 5.6.4.5.5. (system failure warning) may be used.

Annex 6



Special requirements to be applied to the safety aspects of electronic control systems

1.

General

This annex defines the special requirements for documentation, fault strategy and verification with respect to the safety aspects of Electronic System(s) (paragraph 2.3.) and Complex Electronic Vehicle Control System(s) (paragraph 2.4. below) as far as this Regulation is concerned.

This annex shall also apply to safety related functions identified in this Regulation which are controlled by electronic system(s) (paragraph 2.3.) as far as this Regulation is concerned.

This annex does not specify the performance criteria for "The System" but covers the methodology applied to the design process and the information which must be disclosed to the Technical Service, for type approval purposes.

This information shall show that "The System" respects, under non-fault and fault conditions, all the appropriate performance requirements specified elsewhere in this Regulation and that it is designed to operate in such a way that it does not induce safety critical risks.

The applicant (e.g. the manufacturer) may provide evidence that an Auxiliary Steering Equipment (ASE) (if fitted) has previously been assessed as part of an approval in accordance with the requirements of Annex 4 of this Regulation (as required under the original version of this Regulation, its 01 or its 02 series of amendments). In this case, the requirements of this Annex shall not be applied to that ASE for the purposes of an approval in accordance with the 03

series of amendments.

2.

Definitions



For the purposes of this annex,

2.1.

The System" means an electronic control system or complex electronic control system that provides or forms part of the control transmission of a function to which this Regulation applies. This also includes any other system covered in the scope of this Regulation, as well as transmission links to or from other systems that are outside the scope of this Regulation, that acts on a function to which this Regulation applies."

2.2.

" Safety Concept" is a description of the measures designed into the system, for example within the electronic units, so as to address system integrity and thereby ensure safe operation under fault and non-fault conditions, including in the event of an electrical failure. The possibility of a fall-back to partial operation or even to a back-up system for vital vehicle functions may be a part of the safety concept.

2.3.

" Electronic control system" means a combination of units, designed to co-operate in the production of the stated vehicle control function by electronic data processing. Such systems, commonly controlled by software, are built from discrete functional components such as sensors, electronic control units and actuators and connected by transmission links. They may include mechanical, electro-pneumatic or electro-hydraulic elements.

2.4.

" Complex Electronic Vehicle Control Systems" are those electronic control systems in which a function controlled by an electronic system or the driver may be over-ridden by a higher level electronic control system/function. A 47

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

Annex 6



function which is over-ridden becomes part of the complex system, as well as any overriding system/function within the scope of this Regulation. The transmission links to and from overriding systems/function outside of the scope of this Regulation shall also be included.

2.5.

" Higher-Level Electronic Control" systems/functions are those which employ additional processing and/or sensing provisions to modify vehicle behaviour by commanding variations in the function(s) of the vehicle control system.

This allows complex systems to automatically change their objectives with a priority which depends on the sensed circumstances.

2.6.

" Units" are the smallest divisions of system components which will be considered in this annex, since these combinations of components will be treated as single entities for purposes of identification, analysis or replacement.

2.7.

" Transmission links" are the means used for inter-connecting distributed units for the purpose of conveying signals, operating data or an energy supply. This equipment is generally electrical but may, in some part, be mechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic.

2.8.

" Range of control" refers to an output variable and defines the range over which the system is likely to exercise control.

2.9.

" Boundary of functional operation" defines the boundaries of the external physical limits within which the system is able to maintain control.

2.10.

" Safety Related Function" means a function of "The System" that is capable of changing the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. "The System" may be capable of performing more than one safety related function.

2.11.

" Control strategy" means a strategy to ensure robust and safe operation of the function(s) of "The System" in response to a specific set of ambient and/or operating conditions (such as road surface condition, traffic intensity and other road users, adverse weather conditions, etc.). This may include the automatic deactivation of a function or temporary performance restrictions (e.g. a reduction in the maximum operating speed, etc.).

3.

Where functions are combined within a single unit or indeed within a single computer, but shown in multiple blocks in the block diagram for clarity and ease of explanation, only a single hardware identification marking shall be used. The manufacturer shall, by the use of this identification, affirm that the equipment supplied conforms to the corresponding document.

3.3.5.1.

The identification defines the hardware and software version and, where the latter changes such as to alter the function of the Unit as far as this Regulation is concerned, this identification shall also be changed.

3.4.

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

Annex 6



3.4.3.3.

If the chosen provision selects the removal of the Higher Level Function, all the corresponding output control signals associated with this function shall be inhibited, and in such a manner as to limit the transition disturbance.

3.4.4.

The documentation shall be supported, by an analysis which shows, in overall terms, how the system will behave on the occurrence of any of those hazards or faults which will have a bearing on vehicle control performance or safety.



The chosen analytical approach(es) shall be established and maintained by the Manufacturer and shall be made open for inspection by the Technical Service at the time of the type approval.

The Technical Service shall perform an assessment of the application of the analytical approach(es). The assessment shall include:

(a)

(i)

Interactions with other vehicle systems;.

(ii)

Malfunctions of the system, within the scope of this Regulation; (iii)

For functions defined in paragraph 2.3.4. of this Regulation: a.

Situations when a system free from faults may create safety critical risks (e.g. due to a lack of or wrong comprehension of the vehicle environment);

b.

Reasonably foreseeable misuse by the driver;

c.

Intentional modification of the system.

This approach shall be based on a Hazard / Risk analysis appropriate to system safety.

(b)

Inspection of the safety approach at the system level. This may be based on a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) or any similar process appropriate to system safety.

(c)

Inspection of the validation plans and results. This shall include validation testing appropriate for validation, for example, Hardware in the Loop (HIL) testing, vehicle on-road operational testing, or any other testing appropriate for validation.

The assessment shall consist of spot checks of selected hazards and faults to establish that argumentation supporting the safety concept is understandable and logical and validation plans are suitable and have been completed.

The Technical Service may perform or may require to perform tests as specified in paragraph 4. to verify the safety concept.

3.4.4.1.

This documentation shall itemize the parameters being monitored and shall set out, for each fault condition of the type defined in paragraph 3.4.4. of this annex, the warning signal to be given to the driver and/or to service/technical inspection personnel.

3.4.4.2.

This documentation shall describe the measures in place to ensure the "The System" does not prejudice the safe operation of the vehicle when the performance of "The System" is affected by environmental conditions e.g.

climatic, temperature, dust ingress, water ingress, ice packing.

The verification results shall correspond with the description, including the control strategies, provided by the manufacturer in paragraph 3.2.

4.1.2.

Verification of the safety concept of paragraph 3.4.

The reaction of "The System" shall be checked under the influence of a failure in any individual unit by applying corresponding output signals to electrical units or mechanical elements in order to simulate the effects of internal faults within the unit. The Technical Service shall conduct this check for at least one individual unit, but shall not check the reaction of "The System" to multiple simultaneous failures of individual units.

The Technical Service shall verify that these tests include aspects that may have an impact on vehicle controllability and user information (HMI aspects)."

4.1.2.1.

The verification results shall correspond with the documented summary of the failure analysis, to a level of overall effect such that the safety concept and execution are confirmed as being adequate.

5.

Reporting by Technical Service

E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.78/Rev.5

Annex 8



the lateral acceleration is measured, and the centre of gravity of the vehicle shall be identified in the test report. The sampling rate shall be at least 100 Hz.

To determine the lateral acceleration, the raw data shall be filtered by applying a fourth order Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.5 Hz.

To determine the lateral jerk, the 500ms moving average of the time derivation of the filtered lateral acceleration shall be considered.

The lateral acceleration data at the vehicle centre of gravity shall be determined by removing additional effects due to the movements of the vehicle body (e.g.

roll of sprung mass) and by correcting for sensor placement via the use of coordinate transformation. As reference, the intermediate axis system as described in ISO 8855:2011 shall be used.

2.5.

Overriding force

The measurement of the overriding force during the test can be performed by two methods: either through the internal driver torque signal or by an external measurement device fitted, which doesn’t induce any deactivation of the system.

Prior to performing the overriding force test by the internal driver torque signal, it shall be verified by an external measurement device that there are no relevant differences between the both measured values. Differences shall be less than or equal to 3 N. This requirement is deemed to be fulfilled if the correlation between the values of the internal driver torque signal and the external measurement device was determined and is applied in the overriding force test.
