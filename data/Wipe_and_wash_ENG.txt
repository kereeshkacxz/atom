A.2 Method of application of test mixture



A.2.1 The outer surface of the windscreen is completely degreased by wiping with ethyl alcohol or equivalent chemical.

After the windscreen dries, its surface is wiped with ammonium solution of concentration 3 % to 10 %.

Then, the surface is left until its full drying again, and wiped with a cotton lint-free cloth after that.

A.2.2 The newly prepared mixture is shaken, uniformly applied using a sprayer in an amount of 1.5 mg/cm2 ± 20 %, and let it dry out.

A.2.3 The quantity and uniformity of application is determined by weighting of the test samples. Prior to weighting, powder removal is recommended by scraping from all zones other than the ones on the top surface part of the reference regions.

A.2.4 Three reference regions are required for windscreens of the surface area up to 0.5 m2 and five regions if this area is greater than 0.5 m2. Regions shall be evenly spaced over the glass surface outside the wiping zone, including the parking positions, and shall be as close as possible to the wiping zone.

A.2.5 The reference regions shall be at least 1 mm thick and at least 8 cm2 in their surface area (using specimen glasses is recommended).

A.2.6 As agreed with the vehicle manufacturer, the interior heating system of the vehicle or any external system may be used to increase the temperature so as to reduce the drying time after application of the mixture and the start of the test. However, it should be noted that the use of excessive heat may affect the test results.

6



ГОСТ 33993-2016



If artificial drying is in use, achieving the dryness equivalent to the one for natural drying methods is recommended. In this case, heating the glass above 40 °C is not advised.

During the tests, the vehicle shall be at an ambient air temperature (from 10 °C to 40 °C).



A.2.7 Application by other methods



Other methods may be used for application of the test mixture provided that the requirement of A.2.2 is observed.
