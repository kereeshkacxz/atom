Here is the use case based on the provided template:\n\nUse-Case Title (Mandatory): \"Pedestrian Warning System Usage\"\n\nGoal (Maturity A, mandatory): The goal of this use case is to enable the Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS) to emit a sound to alert pedestrians of the approaching electric vehicle (EV) when driving below approximately 32 km/h or while driving in reverse.\n\nContext (Maturity A, optional): The use case is modeled in the context of an electric vehicle operating in urban or residential areas where pedestrians are present.\n\nScope (Maturity A, mandatory): The use case covers the functionality of the Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS) to generate a sound to alert pedestrians of the approaching EV.\n\nActors (Maturity A, mandatory):\n* Human (Mandatory)\n  * Pedestrian\n* System (Optional)\n  * AVAS\n\nPreconditions (Maturity B, mandatory):\n1. The vehicle is driving below approximately 32 km/h or while driving in reverse.\n\nTriggers (Maturity B, mandatory):\n1. The vehicle is in motion and the speed is below approximately 32 km/h or the vehicle is driving in reverse.\n\nMain Scenario (Maturity C, mandatory):\n1. The AVAS system detects that the vehicle is driving below approximately 32 km/h or in reverse.\n2. The AVAS system generates a sound to alert nearby pedestrians of the approaching vehicle.\n3. Pedestrians in the vicinity hear the sound and become aware of the approaching vehicle.\n\nPost-conditions (Maturity B, optional):\n1. Pedestrians know that a vehicle is approaching.\n\nAlternative Scenarios (Maturity C, optional):\nN/A\n\nExceptions (Maturity C, optional):\nN/A\n\nRequirements (Maturity B, optional):\n* The AVAS system shall be able to detect the vehicle speed and driving direction.\n* The AVAS system shall generate a sound that is audible to pedestrians in the vicinity of the vehicle.\n* The sound generated by the AVAS system shall not exceed the maximum sound level specified by regulations.
